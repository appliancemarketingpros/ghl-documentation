## **Overview**

  


  * The **Voice AI Chat Widget** allows visitors to communicate with your AI agent using **real-time voice conversations** directly inside the chat widget.
  * This feature enables users to talk through their browser’s **microphone and speakers** without requiring a phone number, download or call setup.
  * It is currently available under **Labs** , allowing you to enable and test the feature before it becomes generally available.


* * *

## **What the Voice AI Chat Widget does**

  


The Voice AI Chat Widget works as a **voice-only interaction mode** within the existing chat widget framework.  
Visitors can initiate a live voice session by clicking a microphone icon, and the AI agent responds conversationally in real time.

During the session, visitors can:

  * Start or end a voice conversation.

  * Mute or unmute the session as needed.

  * Provide contact information and details verbally.

  * Restart a conversation at any time by disconnecting and calling again.


The AI agent uses your configured Voice AI automations to handle interactions.  
All existing Voice AI actions are supported, except **Call Transfer** , which is currently unavailable.

* * *

## **Key Capabilities**

  * **Browser-based voice calling** directly from the chat widget.

  * **No outbound call** or phone number required.

  * **Configurable AI Agent Name** to match your brand or business.

  * **Automatic call recording notice** displayed for transparency.

  * **Built-in reCAPTCHA protection** to prevent automated or repeated misuse.

  * **Full compatibility** with existing Voice AI actions and workflows.

  * You can create **up****to 100 Voice AI agents.**

### **Step 4:** How visitors interact

When a visitor opens the chat widget:

  1. They’ll see a **microphone icon** indicating voice chat capability.

  2. Clicking the icon starts the live voice session.

  3. The browser requests microphone access (visitors must grant permission).

  4. The AI agent responds conversationally in real time.

  5. Visitors can **start** , **mute** or **end** calls as they prefer.

  6. If the same user rapidly connects and disconnects multiple times (10 times within 60 seconds), the system triggers a **reCAPTCHA** challenge to ensure legitimate use.

## **Best Practices**

  * Choose a **clear, friendly agent name** that fits your brand tone.

  * Add the Voice AI widget to **high-intent pages** , such as “Contact”, “Pricing” or “Demo Request”.

  * Test **microphone permissions** in different browsers to ensure smooth functionality.

  * Keep **background noise** minimal when training or testing your agent.

  * Remind users that calls are not recorded to maintain transparency.

  * Monitor early usage during the Labs phase to understand user behavior and make configuration adjustments as needed to your agent and widget.


* * *

## **Security and Compliance**

The Voice AI Chat Widget includes built-in security and compliance mechanisms:

  * **reCAPTCHA protection** prevents misuse through repeated connect/disconnect activity.

  * A **non-recording notice** is displayed automatically to ensure transparency.

  * All conversations are handled **within the browser** , ensuring user privacy.

  * The feature follows **standard browser permission protocols** for microphone and speaker access.


* * *

## **Troubleshooting**

  


Issue| Possible Cause| Resolution  
---|---|---  
Voice session not starting| Microphone permission not granted| Ask the user to allow microphone access when prompted.  
No audio output| Speakers muted or disconnected| Check audio settings and ensure device output is active.  
Widget not appearing| Script not installed correctly| Re-copy and reinsert the `<script>` tag from the builder.  
Frequent reCAPTCHA prompts| Rapid connection attempts detected| Slow down reconnection frequency to avoid triggering the system.  
Unable to record sessions| Feature not supported| Inform users that call recording is currently unavailable.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do visitors need a phone number or an app download to use it?  
** No, voice conversations happen in the browser using the visitor’s microphone and speakers.

  


**Q: Can I create a Voice AI chat widget without setting up a Voice AI agent first?  
** No, your Voice AI setup and agent creation must be completed before you can create a Voice AI chat widget.

  


**Q: Are calls recorded?  
** The widget displays a non-recording notice, and call recording isn’t supported for this feature.

  


**Q: How do I configure the bot used in the Voice AI Chat Widget?
