# **What is Enhanced Consent Checking for Voice AI Outbound Calling?**

  


HighLevel’s Voice AI performs a pre-call compliance scan to determine whether a contact has provided valid opt-in consent for voice calls. With this enhancement, the consent engine looks beyond standard Forms and also recognizes consent captured via Surveys and Appointment Forms/Calendars. Understanding how consent is stored, evaluated, and surfaced in logs ensures your team can confidently automate compliant outbound calling.

## **Key Benefits of Enhanced Consent Checking**

  
These benefits focus on safer, more reliable outbound operations. Each item highlights how the change reduces risk or improves efficiency for admins and compliance teams.  
  


  * **Broader Coverage:** Consent found in Forms, Surveys, and Appointment Forms/Calendars is now recognized before a call is placed.  
  

  * **Fewer False Blocks:** Valid opt-in from any supported asset allows eligible calls to proceed.  
  

  * **Centralized Compliance:** Pre-call validation reduces manual reviews and keeps workflows moving smoothly.  
  

  * **Better Auditability:** Source and timestamp visibility make reviews and investigations faster.  
  

  * **Future-Ready:** Upcoming tools (consent text audit + bulk updates) simplify ongoing compliance maintenance.


* * *

## **Consent Sources Scanned (Forms, Surveys, Appointment Forms/Calendars)**

  


Knowing every asset type that contributes to the pre-call decision prevents confusion and rework. Use this as your definitive list of sources the system checks before dialing.  
  


  * Forms (existing coverage)  
  

  * Surveys (newly supported)  
  

  * Appointment Forms/Calendars (newly supported)


  

    
    
    Tip: Use consistent consent language across all assets to produce predictable allow/block outcomes.

  


* * *

## **What Counts as “Valid Opt-In”?**

  


Clear criteria prevent misinterpretation and help your legal/compliance team standardize language across assets.  
  


  * A clear, affirmative action (e.g., checked box) indicating consent to receive voice calls.  
  

  * Displayed consent text that references voice calls; avoid vague or bundled language.  
  

  * Timestamp (and when available: submission details like IP/user agent).  
  

  * The consent submission must be associated with the contact and the phone number you intend to call.  
  

  * Maintain language that is region-agnostic and adaptable to your legal framework; consult counsel for jurisdiction-specific requirements.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q: Is opt-out always stronger than opt-in?  
** A: Yes. A recent opt-out or DNC flag blocks calls even if prior opt-in exists.  
  


**Q: Do I need separate consent for each phone number?  
** A: Best practice is number-specific consent. If your policy uses contact-level consent, confirm it with your legal team.  
  


**Q: Are older Survey or Calendar submissions recognized now?  
** A: They can be, provided the submission is associated with the contact and phone number. Verify in the contact timeline and logs.  
  


**Q: Where can I see why a call was blocked?  
** A: Review Voice AI call logs and the contact timeline for the decision, reason, and any available consent source.  
  


**Q: What should my consent text include?  
** A: A clear statement authorizing voice calls, not bundled with unrelated permissions, and presented next to an explicit affirmative action.  


  


**Q: Will the audit & bulk-update tools change my existing text automatically?  
**A: They’re designed to help you review and standardize language. Expect controls to preview and apply changes at scale when released.
