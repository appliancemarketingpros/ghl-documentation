## **Overview**

When a funnel is published on a subdomain (example: `offers.example.com`), Google Ads may reject the landing page due to:

  * **Circumventing Systems**

  * **Compromised Site**

  * **Final URL Mismatch**

  * **Redirect or URL Loop Detected**


This usually happens because the funnel has **two different URLs that load the same page** , such as:

  * `https://offers.example.com/`

  * `https://offers.example.com/summer-deal`


Google Ads sees this as a redirect or URL inconsistency, even though the page loads normally in a browser.

This article explains why it happens and how to fix it.

## **Why This Happens**

Funnels automatically include a **step path** such as:


But many users want the root version:


Both URLs point to the same funnel step, which can lead to:

  * Two URLs → One page

  * Google detecting a redirect or mismatch

  * Google Ads rejecting the landing page


This is normal behavior in funnels, but Google needs one “official” URL.

* * *

## **The Fix: Add a Canonical URL**

A **canonical tag** tells Google:

> “Both URLs are valid, but this one is the official version.”

Adding a canonical tag removes redirect-related disapprovals in Google Ads.

* * *

## **How to Add the Canonical Tag**

  1. Open your **Funnel** → Select the **Funnel Step**.

  2. Click **Settings** (top right).

  3. Scroll to **SEO Meta Data**.

  4. Locate **Custom Head Tracking Code**.

  5. Paste this code:


  6. Replace `offers.example.com` with your actual funnel subdomain.

  7. Save and publish.

## **What This Solves**

  * Removes redirect/mismatch warnings in Google Ads

  * Prevents “final URL mismatch” rejections

  * Ensures Google sees one stable version of the URL

  * Avoids SEO duplicate-content issues

  * Reduces indexing inconsistencies in search engines


* * *

## **When to Use This Fix**

Use this solution if:

  * Your funnel is hosted on a **subdomain**

  * Google Ads rejects the landing page

  * You notice an extra funnel path (e.g., `/summer-deal`)

  * You want the root URL to be recognized as the main landing page

  * Google Search Console reports duplicate URLs


* * *

## **Important Notes**

  * This does **not** change how your funnel behaves for visitors.

  * It only informs Google/Google Ads which URL should be treated as the authoritative version.

  * This is the recommended fix for funnels with multiple accessible URLs.
