Conditional Logic v2 helps you create smarter, more dynamic forms and surveys. It lets you show or hide fields, redirect users, display messages, disqualify leads, or jump to different slides — all based on how someone answers.

This guide explains how to use Conditional Logic, what’s new in version 2, and which fields are supported.

## What Is Conditional Logic

Conditional Logic automates actions inside a form or survey based on user input.  
You can define conditions like:

  * If the answer is “No,” show a message.

  * If the score is below 5, disqualify the lead.

  * If the date is within a range, redirect to another page.

  * In surveys, jump to a specific slide instead of showing all questions.


This creates a more personal and efficient experience for respondents.

## Available Actions

When you open **Conditional Logic** , you’ll see four action types you can create:

  


Action| Description  
---|---  
**Redirect to URL**|  Send users to a specific webpage after submission  
**Display Custom Message**|  Show a personalized message based on answers  
**Disqualify Lead**|  Automatically reject unqualified form submissions  
**Show/Hide Fields**|  Dynamically control which fields appear or hide  
  
> **All conditions are executed in top-down order.**  
>  Later matching rules override earlier ones when applicable.

## **Conditional Logic in Calendar Booking Forms**

  


Conditional logic in forms also applies when a custom form is used inside a supported calendar booking flow. This gives you more control over qualification and the final confirmation experience.

  


In calendar bookings:

  


  * Show/Hide logic updates fields dynamically as the user answers questions  
  

  * Disqualify lead logic is checked before the appointment is booked  
  

  * If a lead is disqualified, the system does not create the appointment  
  

  * If a lead is disqualified, the system does not collect payment  
  

  * Redirects and custom messages can be used as part of the booking outcome


  


If the calendar confirmation page is set to **Use custom form rules** , the system shows the form’s redirect or custom message after submission. If the form does not include either one, the booking uses the default confirmation page instead.

  

    
    
    Note: Calendar support described here applies to supported booking flows that use custom forms. Services (v2) and Rentals are not included in this article yet.

## How to Set Up Conditional Logic

You can add and manage rules directly inside the Form or Survey Builder.

  


### 1\. Open Conditional Logic

  * In the builder, click **Conditional Logic** in the top bar.

### 2\. Add a New Condition

  * Click **Add New Condition**.

  * Choose an action (Redirect, Message, Disqualify, or Show/Hide).

  * The logic builder opens for that action.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055503551/original/Xt1od3MtSIZhhqJP0hV4kKtjTtpLeI4jGQ.jpeg?1759918402)  
  


### 3\. Build the Rule

Follow the guided 3-step flow:

  1. **Select Field** – Choose the form field or slide to base the rule on.

  2. **Select Field State** – Pick the condition (e.g., _is equal to_ , _is empty_).

  3. **Provide a Value** – Enter the matching value (text, number, or date).


You can add additional conditions using **AND** or **OR** connectors.![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055503789/original/xmA291pqzVdAQg74dSgC9HH3litdUtdAYQ.png?1759918521)

> Some operators don’t require values, like “is empty” or “is checked.”

  


### 4\. Choose the Action Result

Depending on the action type:

  * **Redirect:** Add a valid URL (e.g., `https://example.com`)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055504058/original/ZbWmXmVLNXM9XNrEJt9lpyosZAyOKj6Vqw.jpeg?1759918686)

  * **Display Message:** Enter your message text![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055503989/original/o4-6O2Ow5nz5RatX4WwZ6ijD765rkgmpew.jpeg?1759918653)

  * **Show/Hide Fields:** Pick which fields appear or hide![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155055504019/original/bFRfxJVNhE6N6D3znTmcIPqm_-pkAPfaAA.jpeg?1759918668)

  * **Disqualify Lead:** The form stops submission when matched

  * **Jump To (Surveys only):** Choose the target slide or question


### 5\. Save

  * The **Save** button activates only after all required inputs are valid.

  * The system checks for missing values and prevents loops automatically.

  * Rules run **top-down** , and later matches override earlier ones.

## **Survey-Specific Features**

### Jump To Logic

  * **IF Basis:** Field or Slide

  * **THEN Action:** Jump to a slide or question

  * **Evaluation:** Happens when the user clicks “Next”

  * **Conflict Handling:** If multiple Jump To rules match, the first one runs

  * **Protection:** Prevents self-loops and slide-to-slide cycles automatically


### Rule Filtering

In surveys, you can filter rules by:

  * **Field:** Show all rules related to a field

  * **Slide:** Show all rules that affect or belong to that slide


* * *

## **Behavior & Evaluation**

  * Rules execute **top-down** in order.

  * For **Redirect, Message, Disqualify** , only the **first matching rule** runs.

  * For **Show/Hide** , later matches override earlier ones.

  * For **multi-selects** , “is equal to {Option}” checks if the option is selected.

  * Text logic ignores case and extra spaces.

  * Dates use the account’s timezone.


* * *

## Tips

  * Use **Between** for number or date ranges (inclusive).

  * Try date presets like **Today** or **This Week**.

  * The **“Radio Other”** option appears only if enabled for that field.

  * Always preview the form or survey to verify rule behavior.

## FAQs

  


**1\. Can I mix AND and OR in the same rule?**  
No. Each rule must use one type of connector — either AND or OR.

**2\. Can I have multiple rules in the same form?**  
Yes. Each rule works independently.

**3\. What happens if more than one condition matches?**  
For submission actions, the first match wins. For Show/Hide, later rules override earlier ones.

**4\. Can I create loops in Jump To logic?**  
No. The builder prevents loops and shows an error message if detected.
