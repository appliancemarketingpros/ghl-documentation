Email Notifications in Forms & Surveys offer a convenient way to stay updated on form submissions without the need for manual monitoring. With this feature, you can respond promptly, share submission details with team members, and ensure seamless form management. Additionally, Auto Responder allows you to automatically send a confirmation email back to the person who filled out the form.

# **What are Email Notifications in Forms & Surveys?**

  


Email Notifications are alerts sent whenever a form or survey is submitted. These notifications go directly to designated inboxes, keeping teams informed in real time. Auto Responder works alongside this feature, sending an automated reply to the person submitting the form, which may include a copy of their responses.

# **Configure Email Notifications**

  


The Email Notifications sidebar allows you to configure who receives alerts and how the email appears.

  


Configuring email notifications properly ensures that the right team members are informed, and that your notifications appear consistent with your organization’s standards.

  


Click the **Bell icon** in the form editor. Toggle on **Email Notification**.

Fill out the configuration fields:

  


  * **Subject** : Enter a subject line. If left blank, the form or survey name will be used. You can also include a custom field.


  


  * **Email (To)** : Enter one or multiple email addresses. Each address will convert into a tag.


  


  * **Reply-to Email** : Add the email address you want replies directed to.


  


  * **Sender Name** : If left empty, the location or agency name will be used by default.


  


  * **Save** your changes.


  

    
    
    **Note:** Email notifications use email credits. Ensure your account has credits available.

# **Configure Auto Responder**

  


Auto Responder sends an automated email to the contact who submitted the form.

  


Auto Responder helps build trust with contacts by instantly acknowledging their submission and optionally sending them a copy of their responses.

  


Open the **Form Notification** sidebar. Toggle on **Auto Responder**.

  


Fill out the configuration fields:

  


  * **Subject** : Enter a subject line. Default is the form name.


  


  * **Reply-to Email** : Add an email for contact replies.


  


  * **Sender Name** : If blank, defaults to the sub-account name.


  


  * **Save** your changes.


  

    
    
    **Note:** The Reply-To you set here applies only to the auto-responder email that goes to the submitter. It does not affect the team notification email.
    
    Replies to this notification will go to the address set in the "Reply-to-email" field".

# **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Can I send email notifications conditionally, based on how someone answers a form or survey question?**

No, native email notifications in the Form Notification sidebar apply to all submissions equally. If you want conditional routing (for example, send to one team member if the answer is “Option A” and another if it’s “Option B”), you’ll need to use **Workflows**. The “Form Submitted” workflow trigger allows you to set conditions and route notifications accordingly.

  


**Q: Do Auto Responder emails count toward my email credit usage just like notifications?**

Yes. Both **Email Notifications** (sent to your team) and **Auto Responder emails** (sent to the submitter) consume email credits from your account. If your credits are exhausted, neither type of email will send until credits are added. You can monitor credit usage in your account’s email reporting or billing area.

  


**Q: What happens if I enter multiple emails in the “Email (To)” field and one of them is invalid? Will the others still receive the notification?**

Yes. Notifications will still be delivered to valid addresses. Invalid addresses will fail silently and not block delivery to other recipients. However, it’s recommended to regularly verify the addresses entered in the “Email (To)” field to avoid repeated delivery failures.

  


**Q: Can I use dynamic merge fields (like {{user.email}} or {{contact.email}}) in the “Email (To)” field for notifications?**

Currently, merge fields are not supported in the “Email (To)” field. You must enter static email addresses. If you need notifications to go to dynamic recipients, set up a **Workflow** triggered by the form submission and use workflow actions to send email to the appropriate contact or user.
