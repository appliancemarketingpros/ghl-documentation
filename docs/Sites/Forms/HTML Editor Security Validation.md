# HTML Editor Security Validation

## Overview

We’ve added security validation to the **HTML Code Editor** inside:

  * Forms

  * Surveys

  * Quizzes


This update prevents unsafe JavaScript from being saved. It protects accounts from:

  * Cross-site scripting (XSS)

  * Cookie theft

  * Token/session hijacking

  * Account takeover attempts


If unsafe code is detected, the system blocks the save action and displays an error message.

## How It Works

When editing custom HTML:

  1. Open Form / Survey / Quiz Builder

  2. Add an **HTML element**

  3. Click **Edit HTML**

  4. Enter your code


The editor automatically scans the code in real time.

If a security issue is found:

  * A red error message appears below the editor

  * The **Save** button is disabled

  * You must remove the unsafe code before saving


* * *

## What Is Blocked

The editor blocks high-risk JavaScript patterns that can expose sensitive data.

### 1\. Accessing Cookies

Blocked:
    
    
    document.cookie

Also blocked:
    
    
    document['cookie']
    window['document']['cookie']

Cookies may contain authentication data. Accessing them can lead to account compromise.

* * *

### 2\. Using `eval()`

Blocked:
    
    
    eval("alert('hello')")

`eval()` executes arbitrary strings as code and can be used to hide malicious scripts.

* * *

### 3\. Using `new Function()`

Blocked:
    
    
    new Function('return document.cookie')

This dynamically executes string-based code and poses the same risks as `eval()`.

* * *

### 4\. Using `setTimeout()` With a String

Blocked:
    
    
    setTimeout("alert('hi')", 1000)

Allowed:
    
    
    setTimeout(function () {
      alert('hi')
    }, 1000)

Passing a string causes the browser to evaluate it as code.

* * *

### 5\. Using `setInterval()` With a String

Blocked:
    
    
    setInterval('checkStatus()', 5000)

Allowed:
    
    
    setInterval(() => checkStatus(), 5000)

* * *

### 6\. Reading From `localStorage`

Blocked:
    
    
    localStorage.getItem("authToken")

Reading from `localStorage` may expose sensitive session or authentication data.

Allowed:
    
    
    localStorage.setItem("theme", "dark")
    localStorage.removeItem("temp")
    localStorage.clear()

* * *

## What Is Allowed

The following are not blocked:

  * Standard HTML

  * Safe JavaScript logic

  * Arrow functions

  * Function references in timers

  * Writing to `localStorage`

  * `sessionStorage` usage


* * *

## Important Notes

  * Detection is case-insensitive (`eval`, `EVAL`, etc.).

  * If the same issue appears multiple times, only one error message is shown.

  * Empty HTML fields are allowed.

  * Pure HTML (without scripts) is allowed.


* * *

## If Your Code Is Being Blocked

To resolve the issue:

  * Remove any direct cookie access

  * Avoid `eval()` or `new Function()`

  * Use function references instead of string-based timers

  * Do not read authentication or session data from `localStorage`
