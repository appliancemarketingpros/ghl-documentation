# **What is Custom Object Bulk Import?**

  


Custom Object Bulk Import allows you to upload a CSV file to create new Custom Object records, update existing ones, or do both in a single import. It also includes dedupe controls based on unique fields and a centralized Bulk Actions page for tracking progress and resolving issues. This makes Custom Object onboarding faster while helping prevent duplicates and import conflicts.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: When should I use Create vs Update vs Create + Update?**  
A: Use **Create** for brand-new datasets, **Update** to modify existing records only, and **Create + Update** when your CSV contains a mix of new and existing records.

  


**Q: Why am I asked to select a dedupe field?**  
A: If multiple **Unique Fields** are mapped, HighLevel prompts you to choose which unique field should be used for dedupe matching during the import.

  


**Q: What does “strict conflict handling across unique fields” mean?**  
A: If a row would violate unique field rules (such as attempting to assign a unique value that already exists on another record), the import flags that row with errors or warnings so you can correct it.

  


**Q: What does “Update empty values” do?**  
A: It allows empty CSV values to be applied during updates, but **Primary/Required fields are excluded** from empty-value updates.

  


**Q: Can I pause an import and resume it later?**  
A: Yes. Imports can be **Paused** and **Resumed** from **Bulk Actions → Custom Objects**.

  


**Q: What happens if I cancel an import?**  
A: Canceling stops the import from continuing. Already-processed rows may remain applied, depending on what was completed before canceling.

  


**Q: Where do I see which rows failed and how to fix them?**  
A: Open the import details and use the **Stats** modal tabs to view **Errors** and **Warnings**. Row-level messages include **How to Resolve** guidance.

  


**Q: Can I import multiple Custom Objects in one CSV?**  
A: Not yet. **Multi-object import is currently disabled** and shows “Coming soon.”
