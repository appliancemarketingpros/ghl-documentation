# **What are Personality-Style Quizzes?**

  


Personality‑style quizzes group your questions into categories (such as styles, archetypes, or skills). Each answer adds points to one or more categories. When the quiz is submitted, HighLevel totals the points and picks one outcome, usually the highest score (or the lowest if you want to highlight a gap). That outcome shows on the Results page in the Individual Category section, where you can display the category name and score, add a short explanation

## **Key Benefits of Personality-Style Quizzes**

  


  * **Clear Outcomes:** One category is highlighted as the user’s “type” for easy interpretation.  
  


  * **Deeper personalization:** Add custom fields and dynamic values to personalize user journeys, segment quiz results, or show personalized content on results page.  
  

  * **Richer Storytelling:** the Rich Text Editor supports headings, lists, and links for polished result narratives.  
  

  * **Automation‑ready:** Pair results with Workflows (e.g., branch by category) for targeted follow‑up.  
  


  * **Higher Engagement:** Add GIFs, explainer videos, and action-driven CTA buttons directly inside any quiz page.
