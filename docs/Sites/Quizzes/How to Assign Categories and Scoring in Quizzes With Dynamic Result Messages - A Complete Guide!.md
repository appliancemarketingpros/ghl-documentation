## Step 3: Assign Scores to Categories

  


  1. Create score categories (e.g., Category A, Category B, etc.).  
  

         
         **Note:** When you create or edit a category, the in-product category popover explains how categories work—from setup, to assigning options, to showing category scores on the result page. Refer to it as a quick guide while you build.

  2. Assign scores to each answer:  
  


     1. For Single Choice/Dropdown questions, assign a fixed score per answer.  
  


     2. For Multiple Choice/Multi Dropdown, assign a score per option that adds up if multiple choices are selected.  
  


  3. Assign each answer’s score to the relevant category.

## Step 4: Save and Preview

  


  1. Click Save Quiz once you’ve set up all questions and scoring.  
  


  2. Use the Preview option to test the quiz and check if scores are calculated correctly.

## **How Quiz Scoring Works**

  


##  Step 1: Set the Maximum Score for Each Question

  


Every question has a maximum score, which depends on its type:  
  


  * Single Choice/Dropdown: Only one answer can be selected, so the max score is fixed.  
  


  * Multiple Choice/Multi Dropdown: Multiple answers can be selected, so the max score is higher. The max score is fixed and it is the sum of all the options in the dropdown/multiple choice.  
  


#### Example:  
  


  * A Single Choice question might have a max score of 10.  
  


  * A Multiple Choice question might allow up to 50 points.


* * *

## Step 2: Assign Scores to Answers

  


When a quiz-taker selects an answer, it contributes to:  
  


  * Overall Score Only: Counts toward the total quiz score but not any specific category.  
  


  * Category-Specific Score: Counts toward both a specific category and the overall score.  
  


  * Multiple Categories: Affects more than one category at the same time.  
  


Example:  
  


  * If a quiz has Category A, B, and C, and an answer is assigned to Category A, the score counts toward Category A and the Overall Score.


* * *

## Step 3: Calculating the Final Score

  


Once all answers are selected, the final score is calculated using this formula:  
  


Final Score = (Selected Score / Max Score) * 100  
  


This is done separately for Overall Only and for each category.

  


#### **_Example Calculation_**  
  


Category| Selected Score| Max Score| Final %| Final Score Formula  
---|---|---|---|---  
Overall| 90| 130| 69.23%| Selected Score for Overall / Maximum Possible Score for Overall  
Category A| 20| 50| 40.00%| Selected Score for Category A / Maximum Possible Score for Category A  
Category B| 20| 50| 40.00%| Selected Score for Category B / Maximum Possible Score for Category B  
Category C| 10| 50| 20.00%| Selected Score for Category C / Maximum Possible Score for Category C  
  
  
  
In this example:  
  


  * The quiz-taker scored 69.23% overall.  
  


  * For Category A, they scored 20 out of 50, resulting in 40%.


* * *

## Key Takeaways About "Overall Only"

  


  1. "Overall Only" is a Consolidated Score  
  


     * If an answer is assigned only to "Overall Only," it doesn’t count towards any category.  
  


     * If an answer is assigned to both a category and "Overall Only," it is counted in both.  
  


  2. Categories Are Independent but Contribute to the Overall Score  
  


     * Each category's score is calculated separately, but the Overall Score is the sum of all category scores.  
  


  3. Formula Breakdown  
  


     * The Final Score Formula is calculated as:  
Maximum Selected Score for X / Maximum possible score in each category  
  


     * This applies across Overall, Category A, Category B, etc. to derive the percentage scores.

# Add Dynamic Result Messages by Score Ranges

  


You can display different messages depending on a quiz taker’s score percentage.

  


Steps  
  


  1. Go to the Result Page in the quiz builder.  
  


  2. Define your score ranges (for example, Low: 0–40%, Medium: 41–70%, High: 71–100%).  
  


  3. Add a custom message for each range.  
  


  4. Optionally, add a CTA (subscribe, book a call, redirect to funnel, etc.).

Examples

  


  * Low: “There’s room for improvement. Let’s explore how we can help.”  
  


  * Medium: “You’re on the right track. Here’s how to optimize further.”  
  


  * High: “Awesome job! You nailed this. Let’s talk about next steps.”


  


Best Practices

  


  * Double-check category assignments if totals don’t add up.  
  


  * Remember: Overall Only answers do not affect categories.  
  


  * Always preview to confirm scoring accuracy.

  * Match CTAs with outcomes so users take the right next step.  
  

  * Preview often to confirm layout and content on both desktop and mobile.  
  

  * Double-check scoring and category assignments if totals don’t add up.  
  

  * Test edge scores (for example, 40%, 70%) to confirm they map to the correct tiers.
