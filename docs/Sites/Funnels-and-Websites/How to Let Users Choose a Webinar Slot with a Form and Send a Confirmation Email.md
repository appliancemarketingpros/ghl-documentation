## Step 1: Create a Custom Field for Webinar Slots

  1. Navigate to **Settings → Custom Fields**.

  2. Click **\+ Add Field**.

  3. Select **Dropdown** or **Radio Select**.

  4. Name the field: **Choose Your Webinar Time**.

  5. Set the **Object** to **Contact**.

  6. Add your slot options, such as:

     * Tuesday 7PM

     * Thursday 2PM

     * Saturday 11AM

  7. Leave **Allow Custom Values** unchecked. This ensures users can only choose one of your preset times.

  8. Save the field.

## Step 2: Add the Field to a Form

  1. Go to **Sites → Forms → Create (or Edit)**.

  2. From the **Custom Fields** tab, drag the new **Choose Your Webinar Time** field onto your form.

  3. Add other required fields (First Name, Last Name, Email, etc.).

  4. Save the form.


At this point, users can select their webinar slot when registering.

## Step 3: Set Up the Confirmation Email

Form settings only control on-page behavior after submission (thank-you message, redirect, pixels). To send an email, you need a workflow.

  1. Go to **Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow**.

  2. Add a **Trigger: Form Submitted → Select your webinar form**.

  3. Add a **Send Email** action.

     * Subject: Webinar Registration Confirmed

     * Body:

  4. Save and publish the workflow.


Now, every registrant will immediately get a personalized confirmation email with the correct slot.

## Step 4: Optional Reminder Emails or SMS

If you want to send reminders before the webinar:

  1. In the same workflow, add **Wait Until** actions relative to the webinar time.

  2. Send reminders, for example:

     * 24 hours before

     * 1 hour before

     * 10 minutes before


If you run multiple sessions, you can add **If/Else conditions** in the workflow based on the chosen time slot.

## FAQs

**Q1. Should I allow custom values in the dropdown/radio field?**  
No. Keep it unchecked so registrants can only choose from your listed webinar times.

  


**Q2. Can I do this without a workflow?**  
Only if you want a thank-you message on the page. Sending confirmation emails always requires automation.

  


**Q3. Can I branch reminders by time slot?**  
Yes. Add an **If/Else** step in the workflow based on the field value “Choose Your Webinar Time.”
