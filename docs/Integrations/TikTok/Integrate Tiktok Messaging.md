# About TikTok Messaging & Comment automation

TikTok has millions of active customers but they dont provide tools for managing customers, contacts & conversations efficiently at scale. You want to automate some amount of these activities, so the conversations happen in FBIG, but are managed from inside your CRM.

  


All you have to do is configure several different components correctly. This guide will explain each of those components, several patterns for making them work together.

# Eligible Geographies 

The **TikTok Messaging & Comment Automation** feature is **not yet available** in the **European Economic Area (EEA)** , **Switzerland** , or the **United Kingdom (UK)**.

Currently, this feature is **available only for business accounts registered in the United States**.

This limitation is due to **restrictions within TikTok’s public APIs**.
