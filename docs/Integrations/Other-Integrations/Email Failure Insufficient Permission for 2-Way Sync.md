If you are seeing an email error that says **insufficient permission** , it means Gmail is blocking email sending due to missing or revoked permissions.

This usually happens in the following scenarios:

  1. **Password Changed** – Your email password was changed after the integration was set up.

  2. **Access Revoked** – The LeadConnector app’s access was disconnected from your Gmail account settings.

  3. **Incomplete Permission Granted** – At the time of integration, all required permissions (scopes) were not selected when authorizing Gmail access.

## **How to Fix This**

### Step 1: Reconnect 2-Way Sync

  * Clear your browser **cache and cookies**.

  * Go to **Settings → Email → 2-Way Sync**.

  * Reconnect your Gmail account and make sure all permissions requested are granted.


### Step 2: Remove & Reconnect (if issue persists)

If the error still occurs:

  1. Go to your **Google Account → Security → Third-party apps with account access**.

  2. Remove the **LeadConnector app**.

  3. Return to your LeadConnector account and re-connect Gmail for 2-way sync.


This will refresh the connection and resolve insufficient permission issues.

## **Important Notes**

  * Always grant **all requested permissions** during integration.

  * If your password changes, you will need to reconnect the integration.

  * Ensure the connected Gmail account has the necessary sending/receiving permissions.
