## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Can I quickly disable custom code to troubleshoot?**

Yes. Turn **Live Mode** off.

  


**Q: What should I do if I'm experiencing issues in a community after applying custom code?**

If you encounter any problems within a community where custom HTML, CSS, or JavaScript has been implemented, it's important to isolate whether the issue is being caused by the custom code. To do this, you can temporarily disable the custom code and see if the problem still occurs. Simply add 'customCode=false' to the end of the community's URL in your browser's address bar and press Enter. This action deactivates the custom code for your current session, allowing you to check if the issue persists without the customizations. If the problem is resolved with custom code disabled, it indicates that adjustments to your custom code may be necessary.

  


**Q: How can I apply different styles for dark mode vs. light mode in my community portal?**

To target night mode (dark theme) styles specifically, use the .dark class in your CSS. This class is automatically applied to the root when night mode is active.

Avoid using overly broad selectors like div:nth-of-type(2) unless you’re absolutely sure it won’t impact other parts of the page. Always preview and test both modes to ensure visual consistency.
