# What is the ClientPortal Builder Enhancement Pack (Branded Apps)?

This set of enhancements improves how agencies launch and manage white-labeled branded apps. It introduces a guided onboarding option (Book a Call), a clear in-app status for paused/cancelled subscriptions (Cancelled from Live screen), and operational improvements (re-subscriptions, webhook integrations, and auto subscription creation) so teams can move from setup to live status faster and keep apps running reliably.

## Key Benefits of the Enhancement Pack

These advantages focus on faster go-live, clearer lifecycle messaging, and stronger automation so agencies and clients spend less time troubleshooting and more time engaging users.

  * Faster go-live: Guided onboarding helps agencies complete store and branding steps quickly.  
  


  * Proactive churn management: A visible Cancelled from Live screen prompts timely renewal and reduces downtime.  
  


  * Automation-ready: Enhanced webhooks and auto subscription creation streamline reselling and provisioning.  
  


  * Retention support: Re-subscription handling makes it easier to bring churned apps back online.  
  


  * Operational clarity: Cancellation reasons are captured for coaching and process improvement.


## “Book a Call” (Agencies) — Guided Onboarding

This option connects agencies with HighLevel specialists to accelerate branded app setup—ideal for first-time launches or when internal capacity is tight.

What it does

  * Lets agencies schedule a setup call directly from the ClientPortal Builder (exclusive to agency accounts).  
  


  * Targets adoption and time-to-live by walking you through required steps and best practices.  
  


  * Clarifies store requirements, assets, and submission timelines before work begins.  
  


What to prepare

  * App name, brand colors, logo and app icons (required sizes), splash screens.  
  


  * Apple App Store / Google Play developer account access.

## “Cancelled from Live” Screen — Proactive Churn Management

When an app subscription is paused or cancelled, users see a clear in-app status page. This improves visibility, sets expectations, and nudges account owners to resume service quickly.

How it works

  * Displays a status screen indicating the app is no longer live.  
  


  * Explains that action is required to restore access.  
  


  * Emphasizes customer impact, adding urgency to renew.  
  


What users can do

  * Follow the on-screen instructions to renew/resume the subscription.  
  


  * If needed, contact the agency or support using the link(s) provided.

## Re-subscription Handling for Churned Users

Recovering churned apps is easier. The flow supports restoring access, aligning billing, and getting the branded app back in customers’ hands quickly.

Key details

  * Supports returning to an active state after a pause/cancel.  
  


  * Keeps subscription state, billing, and access aligned once payment succeeds.  
  


  * Minimizes manual steps for teams bringing apps back online.  
  


## Webhook Automation & Reselling Improvements

Integrations are more powerful with enhanced reselling webhooks and the option to automatically create subscriptions via webhook, enabling hands-off provisioning.

What’s improved

  * Enhanced reselling webhook integration with ClientPortal branded apps for cleaner partner workflows.  
  


  * Automatic subscription creation via webhooks so new customers get provisioned without manual setup.  
  


  * Better end-to-end lifecycle coverage for create → pause/cancel → resume.  
  


Implementation tips

  * Use secure, idempotent webhook endpoints.  
  


  * Log payloads and responses for auditing and support.  
  


  * Test create/resume/cancel flows in a staging environment before production.


## Capture Cancellation Reasons

Educational description:  
Understanding why customers cancel supports better coaching, pricing, and product decisions—closing the loop on churn reduction.

How it works

  * Users provide a cancellation reason within the branded app.  
  


  * Responses can be used for reporting, outreach, and process improvements.  
  


  * Combine qualitative feedback with subscription events to spot patterns.
