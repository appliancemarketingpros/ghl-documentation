Smart Tags help you **visually prioritize opportunities** inside your pipelines using color-coded chips. Instead of relying on filters or text labels, you can highlight deals automatically based on rules you define — such as stale deals, high-value opportunities, or new leads.This article shows you how to create, edit and manages smart tags in HighLevel.

# **What is Smart Tags?**

  


Smart Tags are dynamic, rule-based color chips that appear directly on each Opportunity card inside a pipeline. Powered by an easy conditional builder, these tags evaluate every Opportunity in real time, then automatically apply a colored label whenever the record meets your criteria (e.g., deal value > $10 000). The result is an at-a-glance, visual layer that eliminates the need for manual filters or tedious scanning.

## **Key Benefits of Smart Tags**

  


  * **Immediate prioritization:** High-impact deals jump off the screen.  
  

  * **Less context-switching:** No need to open each card or apply multiple filters.  
  

  * **Consistent team focus:** Everyone sees the same color cues, driving aligned action.  
  

  * **Custom to every workflow:** Build any combo of AND/OR conditions across Standard or Custom Opportunity fields.


* * *

## **Permissions & Access**

  


  * **Who can create or edit Smart Tags:**  
**  
**
    * Agency Admins  
  

    * Location Admins  
  

    * Users with Pipeline Edit Permissions  
  

  * **Who can view Smart Tags:**  
**  
**
    * All users (with Pipeline View Permission - even without editing permissions)


* * *

## **Limits & Validation**

  


  * Each pipeline supports **up to 60** active Smart Tags.  
  

  * Duplicate tags in the same pipeline (same color + rule) are blocked automatically.  
  

  * Tags update automatically as deal data changes — no manual refresh required.

### _**Step 2:** Creating a Smart Tag_

  


  1. Click **Add Smart Tag.**  
  
**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/xs6WW87OttyVfYr6Io9l+/Screen+Shot+2025-10-14+at+10.21.18+PM.png)**  
  


  2. Choose between:  
  


     * **Create New Tag:** Define your own color, name, and rule conditions.  
  


     * **Pre-Built Tag:** Use one of our default templates (e.g., _New Lead_ , _High Value_).

  3. Enter a **Label Name** (e.g., “Stale Deal”).  
  


  4. Add a **Description** for clarity. (Optional)   
  


  5. Pick a **Color** for the tag.  
  


  6. Check **Apply to all pipelines** if you want this rule used globally.  
  


  7. Click **Next: Add Rule.**  
  
**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/Y24qhRMvGpdtEt8pRgOr+/Screen+Shot+2025-10-14+at+10.28.48+PM.png)**  
  


### _**Step 3:** Defining Rules_

  


  1. Use the rule builder to specify **when the tag appears**.  
  

  2. Each tag is rule-based — for example:  
  

     * **Created Date ≤ 3 days ago →** “New Lead”  
  

     * **Deal Value > $10,000 →** “High Value”  
  

  3. You can:  
  

     1. Combine multiple conditions with **AND / OR logic**  
  

     2. Add nested filters for complex logic  
  

     3. Use **Preview Tag** to see how it’ll appear on a sample card  
  

     4. When done, click **Save.**

  * After the tag is created, users can easily **preview, edit or delete tags** directly from the smart tags page.

## **Recommended Pre-Built Tags**

  


Tag Name| Color| Rule Example| Purpose  
---|---|---|---  
**Stale Deal (Coming soon)**|  Grey| Last Activity before 14 days ago| Highlight neglected opportunities  
**High Value**|  Green| Opportunity Value > $10,000| Flag big-ticket deals  
**New Lead**|  Blue| Created Date ≤ 3 days ago| Track new opportunities  
**At Risk (Coming soon)**|  Red| Last Stage Change > 30 days ago and Status = "Open"| Warn of deals going cold  
**Hot Deal**|  Orange| Created On < 7 Days and Opportunity Value > $5000| Highlights recently created, high-ticket opportunities.  
**Unassigned Deal**|  Purple| Owner is empty| Spot opportunities without owners

## **Best Practices**

  


✅ Use distinct colors for your top priorities (e.g., red for urgent, green for high-value).  
  
✅ Keep tag names short — under 20 characters.  
  
✅ Review rules regularly to ensure relevance.

## **Troubleshooting**

  


  * **Smart Tags not visible on cards?**  
**  
**
    * Ensure Smart Tags are added to your card layout (via Customize Card).  
  

    * Check that the rule conditions are correct and apply to the cards you’re viewing.  
  

    * Do a hard refresh to sync the changes on the pipeline.


  


  * **Missing the Smart Tags tab?**  
**  
**
    * Only Admins can access tag creation and editing.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do Smart Tags work across all pipelines?  
** Yes — if you select “Apply to all pipelines,” the tag will appear wherever its rule conditions are met.

  


**Q: Can I duplicate Smart Tags between pipelines?  
** Not yet, but you can reapply the same rule manually in another pipeline.

  


**Q: Are Smart Tags included in reports?  
** Currently, Smart Tags display visually in the pipeline view only. 

  


**Q: Who can create or edit Smart Tags?**

Any user with permission to edit a pipeline’s settings can manage Smart Tags. Use Pipeline Permissions to restrict access if needed. 

  


**Q: Are Smart Tags evaluated in real time?**

The system re-checks all tag rules whenever an Opportunity is created, updated, or when its stage/status changes.
