## **What are Pipeline Permissions?**

  


Pipeline Permissions define visibility and editing rights for individual pipelines inside Opportunities. Admins can grant access to everyone, target specific roles/users, or explicitly exclude users—without changing broader sub-account roles. This granular visibility keeps data secure and lets sales teams focus only on the deals that matter to them.

## **Key Benefits of Pipeline Permissions**

  


  * **Consistency:** preserve stage names/order while allowing reps to work deals.  
  

  * **Data privacy:** hide revenue/board data from contractors or new staff.  
  

  * **Granular control:** share with all, specific users, or exclude exceptions.  
  

  * **Auditability:** track who changed pipeline settings for compliance needs.  
  

  * **Cross-platform:** the same permissions apply on web and the HighLevel mobile app.  
  

  * **Dashboards parity:** widgets and metrics honor pipeline access and Assigned Data.

## **Sharing Modes for Pipeline Permissions**

  


Three flexible ways to share each pipeline let you mirror any org structure.  
  


  * **Share with All Users:** grant everyone View Only, Edit or No Access in one click.  
  

  * **Share with Selected Users:** pick individual users/roles and set View Only, Edit, or No Access for each.  
  

  * **Exclude specific users:** keep the pipeline global, then remove access for a few exceptions.

## **Access Levels****for Pipeline Permissions**

  


Clear labels make it obvious what each person can do.

  

    
    
    **Note:** **Admin** user will always have **full** **access** to the pipeline.

  


  * **View Only:** move and update opportunities, but cannot add/edit/delete stages or pipelines.  
  

  * **Edit:** full control to add, edit, and delete pipeline stages (including the pipeline itself).  
  

  * **No Access:** the pipeline is completely hidden in web, mobile, and API responses.

## **Audit Logs & Safeguards for Pipeline Permissions**

  


HighLevel **automatically logs** every create, update, or revoke action with user, pipeline, action, and timestamp for **60 days**. This audit trail simplifies troubleshooting and compliance reviews. 

  


  1. Navigate to **Settings → Audit Logs.**  
  
**![](https://jumpshare.com/share/OZguNUBFCClOrApXHjfL+/GIF+Recording+2026-02-09+at+7.58.37+PM.gif)**  
  

  2. Filter by**User** , **Module** \- **Pipeline Permissions, Actions, Date Range** to view who changed what, and when.

  3. The system also **prevents you from revoking access from anyone who currently owns opportunities in that pipeline**. You’ll be prompted to reassign ownership first.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: What’s the difference between “View Only” and “No Access”?**

View-only users can still move or update their assigned opportunities inside the pipeline. No Access hides the pipeline completely.

  


**Q: What if a user already owns opportunities and I set them to No Access?**

High-level blocks that change. Reassign or delete their opportunities first, then remove access.

  


**Q: Do permissions sync to the mobile app?**

Yes. The same rules apply across web, iOS, Android, and all API responses.

  


**Q: Can I bulk-assign permissions to a role instead of each user?**

Yes—roles appear in the selector. Everyone in that role inherits the chosen level.

  


**Q: Will permission changes break active automations or webhooks?**

No. Automations continue to run. However, API calls made with a user token that lacks access will return an empty pipeline list.

  


**Q: Is there an “Owner Only” option?**

Use “Share with selected users” **>** choose the owner **>** set others to No Access for a true owner-only pipeline.

  


**Q: How long are Audit Logs retained?**

60 days of history are available for download or review.
