## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does turning this setting ON change existing opportunities?**  
Existing opportunity cards remain as they are. Enabling simply allows additional cards for the same contact (including in the same pipeline).  
  


**Q: What happens if I turn the setting OFF later?**  
Existing opportunity cards are not deleted. The system will restrict new duplicate opportunities for the same contact in the same pipeline; review automations to avoid create/update errors.  
  


**Q:****Can a contact have multiple opportunities across different pipelines even if the setting is OFF?**  
The setting governs **same-contact duplicates within the same pipeline**. Your pipeline model and creation rules determine cross-pipeline behavior; test your workflow logic to confirm.  
  


**Q: How do I make sure automations act on the right card?**  
Use **Find Opportunity** to select earliest/latest or condition-based matches, and set entry filters to prevent unintended re-entry.  
  


**Q:****Will forecasts double-count revenue?**  
Forecasts and pipeline totals reflect **all** open opportunities; ensure your dashboards and reports are designed for that reality.  
  


**Q: Is this the same as the “Duplicate Opportunity” option inside a workflow step?**  
No. Workflow duplicates control **that action’s** behavior. The global setting controls whether the CRM **allows** multiple cards per contact.  
  


**Q: Do I need to update user permissions?**  
Confirm users can access pipelines and create/update opportunities; adjust roles as needed.  
  


**Q: How do I avoid duplicate messaging when multiples exist?**  
Add guardrails: use **Find Opportunity** , tighten triggers, and apply re-entry rules or suppression conditions.
