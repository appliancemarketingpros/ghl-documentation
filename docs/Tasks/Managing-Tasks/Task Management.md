## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**How can I schedule a task due at a specific time from a workflow?**

Use the “Add Task” workflow action and switch the “Due In” field to Dynamic Mode. This allows you to input a specific date and time (e.g., 05-30-2025 03:00 PM) using a custom value or dynamic variable.

  
**Can workflows create contact-less tasks?**   
Yes—**Add Task** will create a standalone task when no contact is present.

  
**How do I find them?**

Filter by **Contact = Unassigned** (or the “no contact” token) and optionally add **Assignee** \+ **Due**.

  
**Do reminders/notifications apply to contact-less tasks?**

Yes—add them via workflows (e.g., **Task Reminder** trigger + **Internal Notification**). They’re not sent automatically unless you configure them.
