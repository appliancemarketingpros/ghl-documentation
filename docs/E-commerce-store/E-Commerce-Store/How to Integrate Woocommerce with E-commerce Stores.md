# **What is the WooCommerce Integration?**

  


The WooCommerce integration connects a WooCommerce store to a HighLevel sub-account so you can import historical records and keep new purchases in sync. Once connected, HighLevel can bring in contacts, orders, and transactions from WooCommerce and let you use order-related events in your automations. 

  


Additionally, WooCommerce store owners can leverage GHL’s marketing tools, including triggers like Order Submitted Trigger and Payment Received Trigger for better automation.

## **Key Benefits of the WooCommerce Integration**

  


  * **Centralized order visibility** : view WooCommerce orders inside HighLevel once syncing is enabled.  
  


  * **Contact enrichment** : create or update HighLevel contacts from WooCommerce purchases, including guest checkouts.  
  


  * **Targeted automations** : trigger workflows from order-related events such as order submission or payment receipt.  
  


  * **Selective control** : choose which data types to import initially and which to keep in ongoing sync (contacts, orders, transactions).  
  


  * **Reimport option** : reimport historical data by disconnecting and reconnecting when needed.


* * *

## **How To Setup the WooCommerce Integration**

  


Proper setup ensures historical data imports correctly and new orders continue to sync to your sub-account.

  

    
    
    **Note:** To **reimport** data later, **disconnect** and **reconnect** , then select what to import again.

Yes. If **Order Sync** is enabled, contacts are created from orders even when **Contact Sync** is off.

  


**Q: How are guest checkout orders handled?**

Guest checkout buyers are created as **contacts** , but no updates or future syncs occur for these guest accounts.

  


**Q: How do WooCommerce order statuses map to HighLevel?**
