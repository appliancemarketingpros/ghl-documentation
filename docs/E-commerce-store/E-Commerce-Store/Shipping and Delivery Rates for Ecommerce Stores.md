# **What Are Shipping Zones?**

  


Shipping zones let store owners define delivery regions where shipping costs vary. For example, you can charge different rates for different states or regions within a country.

  


By creating multiple zones, you can assign rates that reflect your actual delivery costs while giving customers transparent pricing at checkout.

## **Setting Up Shipping Zones**

  


Shipping zones group together specific countries, states, or provinces that share the same delivery rules. Once a zone is created, you can define flat or conditional rates for that region.

  


**Steps to Create a Shipping Zone:**  
  


  1. Go to **Sub-Account → Payments → Settings → Shipping & Delivery.**  
  


  2. Click **Add Zone.**  
  


  3. Enter a **zone name** (for example, “US East Coast” or “Canada West”).  
  


  4. Select one or more **countries** and the relevant **states/provinces** for that zone.  
  


  5. Click **Add Rate** to define shipping costs for this region.  
  


  6. (Optional) Add **conditional pricing** based on weight or total order value.

## **Buyer’s Preview on the Checkout Page**

  


Once your zones and rates are configured, customers automatically see the available shipping options at checkout. The system applies the correct rate based on their address and cart details.

## **Limit Shipping Zones by ZIP/Postcode**

  


When creating or editing a shipping zone, you can restrict the zone so it only applies to specific ZIP/postcodes. This helps you support hyper-local deliveries or prevent shipping to certain areas by controlling where a zone applies.

  


**Enable ZIP/Postcode Restriction**

  


1\. Go to Payments → Settings → Shipping & Delivery.

2\. Open your Shipping Profile (General or Custom), then go to Shipping Zones.

3\. Create a zone or edit an existing zone.

4\. Enable Limit Shipping to Specific ZIP/Postcodes.

5\. Enter ZIP/postcodes using commas to separate values.

  


**Accepted Input Formats**

  


Single code (example: "100210")  
Comma-separated codes (example: "100210,122021")  
Wildcard prefix (example: **46*** to match all ZIP/postcodes starting with "46")

  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064561230/original/nB2u6Eh5gWajTqt4MYF6l69T5gLhYccZMw.png?1770717111)  


**Validation Rules**

The wildcard asterisk (`*`) is allowed only at the end of an entry (example: **56***).

Duplicate or invalid values are blocked.

If ZIP/postcode restriction is enabled, the zone cannot be saved unless at least one valid ZIP/postcode is entered.

  


If the customer ZIP/postcode does not match the configured entries, that shipping zone does not apply.

## **Setting Up Conditional Pricing for Shipping Rates**

  


Conditional pricing allows you to adjust shipping costs dynamically based on the total **order amount** or the **total weight** of items in the cart. This helps you set fair delivery charges while rewarding higher-value purchases or managing costs for heavier shipments.

  


You can configure shipping rates in two ways:  
  


  * **By Order Price** — Set rates based on how much the customer spends.  
  


  * **By Item Weight** — Set rates based on the total product weight in the order.


  


For example, you can offer **free shipping** for higher-value or heavier orders, and apply a **standard rate** for smaller ones.  
  


  * **Free Shipping:** Orders over **$500** or weighing **10 kg and above.**

  * **Standard Shipping:** Charge **$10** for orders below **$500** or weighing less than **10 kg.**


  


  


### **How to Add Conditional Pricing**

  


  1. Navigate to **Sub-Account → Payments → Settings → Shipping & Delivery.**  
  


  2. Under your shipping zone, click **Add Rate** and enable **Conditional Pricing.**  
  


  3. Choose whether you want to condition the rate **By Order Price** or **By Item Weight.**

  4. Define the **Minimum** and (optional) **Maximum** values for your range.

     * Example: 0–10 kg for weight-based, or $0–$500 for price-based.  
  


  5. Enter the **rate amount** that applies to that condition (e.g., $10 for standard delivery).  
  


  6. Click **Add** to save your rate.


  


Once saved, these rates will automatically apply at checkout based on the customer’s cart details and location.

## **Notes and Best Practices**

  


Keep these tips in mind to prevent setup conflicts and ensure accurate pricing:  
  


  * You can create **different zones** for each region and assign unique rates.  
  


  * Once a **state/province** is assigned to one zone, it **cannot be reused** in another.  
  


  * You can define **multiple weight or price ranges** within a single zone.  
  


  * Always test checkout after adding new zones or conditions to confirm correct rate display.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q1: Can I set both weight-based and price-based conditions in the same zone?**

Yes. You can create multiple rates within a zone, each using different conditions—one by price, another by weight. This lets you mix and match based on your store’s needs.

  


**Q2: What happens if a customer’s address doesn’t fall into any defined shipping zone?**

If a buyer’s address isn’t covered by a custom zone, the system will not display a rate. To prevent this, create a **d** efault fallback zone that covers all remaining countries or states.

  


**Q3: Can I offer free shipping for select products only?**

Currently, free shipping is applied at the zone or condition level, not per individual product. To create product-specific free shipping, group those products into a dedicated zone and assign a “Free” rate.

  


**Q4: What’s the best way to handle multiple countries with similar shipping costs?**

Group them under one zone (e.g., “US & UK Zone”) and assign shared rates. This keeps your setup organized and prevents duplicate configurations.

  
**Q5: How can I test my setup?**

Add products to a test order and go through checkout using different addresses to verify the rates appear correctly based on your zones and conditions.
