# **What is Inbound Spam Call Reduction in HighLevel?**

  


Inbound spam call reduction is a layered configuration that identifies likely spam before agents engage, quarantines repeat offenders automatically, and adds a light IVR “front door” to deter bots. Combining detection (Number Intelligence), agent input (Custom Dispositions), and automation (DND + IVR) delivers strong protection without blocking real customers.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Inbound Spam Call Reduction**

  


Understanding the outcomes helps you deploy the right balance of protection and accessibility. These benefits focus on reducing interruptions, preserving lead flow, and keeping rollback options simple.

  


  * **Fewer agent interruptions** : reduce spam that rings through to users.


  


  * **Faster handling** : agents can mark a call as **Spam call** with one tap/click.


  


  * **Automatic quarantine** : a workflow places marked numbers in **DND** to prevent future inbound rings.


  


  * **Front-door screening (IVR)** : simple keypress prompts repel robocalls while routing real people quickly.


  


  * **Safe-list & rollback**: VIPs can bypass filters; DND can auto-clear after review or X days.


  


  * **Measurable impact** : track “Spam Likely” rates, IVR completion, and fewer agent-handled spam calls.


* * *

## **Number Intelligence (Spam Detection, Caller ID & Validation)**

  


Number Intelligence adds network-level signals (e.g., **Spam Likely**) to your call logs and phone experience. Turning it on provides early detection so you can flag/route suspicious calls before agents engage.

  


  * **Where to enable:** **Settings → Phone System → Additional Settings → Number Intelligence** (sub-account).


  


  * **Scope & notes:** Spam Detection/Caller Name Lookup availability and pricing are documented in the Number Intelligence article; charges are usage-based per lookup/event. Availability may vary by country; **Spam Detection is most effective in the U.S. (for more information, refer to this article:[Number Intelligence - Spam Detection, Caller ID & SMS Validation](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001153968>)**


  


  * ****Verify it’s working:** Look for **Spam Likely** indicators on inbound calls in call logs and supported dialer views.**


* * *

## **Custom Dispositions for Voice Calls (Create “Spam call”)**

  


Custom Dispositions standardize agent feedback. Adding a **Spam call** disposition lets agents consistently label unwanted calls, which your workflow can use to auto-quarantine future attempts.

  


  * **Create the disposition:** **Settings → Phone System → Dispositions → Add Disposition → Name: “Spam call” → Save**.


  


  * **Where agents use it:** Call end screen (web and mobile).


  


  * **Guidelines:** Keep the label short and unambiguous (e.g., **Spam call**).


* * *

## **Workflow — Contact DND (Quarantine Marked Spam)**

  


Workflows operationalize your policy. When an agent marks **Spam call** , a workflow can enable **DND** for that contact—silencing future inbound rings from the same number while preserving your ability to reach out if needed.

  


**Recommended safe preset (clarity on terms):**

  


  * **Direction** controls which way communication is blocked (e.g., **Inbound**).


  


  * **Channels** control _what_ is blocked (e.g., **Voice** vs **All channels**). Start conservatively with **Inbound + Voice** so legitimate SMS/email aren’t affected.


  


**Recipe:**

  1. **Trigger:** **Call Details**.

  2. **Filter:** **Disposition = Spam call** (and optionally **Direction = Inbound**).

  3. **Action:** **Enable/Disable DND** → **Direction = Inbound** → **Channels = Voice** → Save & Publish.


* * *

## **Interactive Voice Response (IVR) — Light Front-Door Filter (Optional)**

  


A minimal IVR (“Press 1/2”) deters robocalls and routes people quickly. Keep it short to avoid friction for urgent-use businesses.

  


**Minimal 2-option IVR template:**

  


  * **Say/Play:** “To reach support, press 1. For new inquiries, press 2.”

  * **Gather Input (DTMF)** → **Map Input** :

    * **1 → Connect Call** to Support Team or User/Group

    * **2 → Connect Call** to Sales

  * **Timeout/Invalid:** **Repeat once** , then **Voicemail** or **Fallback agent**

  * **Constraint:** One phone number can be mapped to **one IVR workflow** at a time.


  


**Build path:**

  * **Trigger:** **Start IVR** (map your inbound number to this workflow).

  * **Actions:** **Say/Play → Gather Input → Map Input → Connect Call** (+ Voicemail fallback).


* * *

## **VIP/Safe List & Auto-Clear DND (Rollback Patterns)**

  


False positives happen. These two patterns preserve accessibility for key callers and automatically restore access after review or elapsed time.

  


  * **VIP / Safe List Bypass:**

    * Add tag **VIP** or **SafeList** on contact.

    * In the DND workflow, add an **If/Else** before DND: **If contact has tag VIP/SafeList → Skip DND** ; else → apply DND.

  * **Auto-Clear DND After X Days (e.g., 30):**

  * Create a workflow with **Trigger: Contact DND** (or schedule-based logic), **Wait: 30 days** , **Action: Disable DND** (or notify a reviewer first).

  * Optionally remove a “Quarantined–Spam” tag upon review.


* * *

## **Mobile Visibility (Spam Labels on App)**

  


Seeing “Spam Likely” on mobile reassures agents that filters are working when away from desktop.

  


  * **Requirement:** HighLevel Mobile App **v3.97.3 or later**.

  * **Experience:** “Spam Likely” appears on call lists and details where supported.


* * *

## **How To Set Up Inbound Spam Call Reduction (Step-by-Step)**

  


Correct order reduces risk and speeds verification. Complete each step and test before moving on.

  


  


### **Step 1 — Enable Number Intelligence**

  


  1. Go to **Settings → Phone System → Additional Settings → Number Intelligence**.

  2. Check **Gather Intelligence on Unknown Phone Numbers**.

  3. Save.


  

    
    
    **Agency onboarding tip:** In **Agency View** , you can set defaults so new sub-accounts start with Number Intelligence enabled by default. See Understanding Default Phone Preferences for New Sub-Accounts.

### **Step 3 — Auto-enable Inbound DND (Calls) for spam-labeled contacts**

  


  1. Create a **Workflow**.

  2. **Trigger:** **Call Details**.

  3. **Add Filters:** **Direction = Inbound** AND **Disposition**

  4. **Action:** **Enable/Disable DND (Contact)** → Enable **Inbound → Calls** only.

  5. Optional branches: **VIP tag** skip; **Remove DND** path if corrected.

  6. Publish.

### **Step 4 — Using IVR Workflow**

  

    
    
     This article provides some of the important steps only. For more details, refer to the below help article :
    [Interactive Voice Response (IVR) Guide - Triggers & Actions
    ](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000001200-interactive-voice-response-ivr-guide-triggers-actions>)

  


  


  * Start by creating a new **Workflow** and choose the **Start IVR Trigger**.


  


  * In **Filters** , set **In Phone Number** and select the public line you want to screen (note: if a number doesn’t appear, it may already be in use by another workflow). 


  


  * Add **Gather Input on call** and use **Say a message** to deliver a short prompt such as “Thanks for calling [Business]. To connect, press 1.” 


  


  * Choose your **Language** , **Message Voice** , keep **Number of loops** at 1, and in **Advanced Settings** set a brief **timeout** (about 3–5 seconds) with one retry; accept only digit **1**. 


  


  * For callers who press **1** , add **Connect Call (IVR)** and select your **Users** or **Add custom number** ; optionally enable **Detect Voicemail** , consider whether to **Record Call** , and set a reasonable **Timeout (seconds)**. 


  


  * For callers who don’t respond or press the wrong key, add **Say or play a message** with a concise “We didn’t catch that” notice, then **End Call (IVR)** (or route to voicemail if preferred). 


  


  * **Publish** , then place test calls from a mobile and a landline to confirm the “press 1” path connects and the fallback path ends cleanly.


  


  


Create a new **Workflow** or update your existing number flow.

**Trigger:** **Start IVR** tied to your public inbound number.

  


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064903775/original/9fS-rImrX9eH1SH2pNlEvl9lnuxRBRHr2w.jpeg?1771007437)

  


  


**IVR Gather Input on Call:** expect “1”; timeout ~3–5 seconds; 1 retry.

**Say or Play Message example:** “Thanks for calling [Business]. To connect, press 1.”

  


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064903720/original/sNYoYLfYNiIwQ9AmC5_UoY-kqDKyE21l4Q.png?1771007342)

  


  


### **Step 5 — Validate call flow & timeouts**

  


  1. Open **Phone Numbers → [Select Number] → Incoming Calls Settings**.

  2. Confirm the IVR/workflow association and set **ring timeout** (e.g., ~20 seconds).

  3. Place 3–5 test calls (unknown number; marked-spam number; VIP number) and verify outcomes.


  


  


### **Step 6 — Monitor & tune**

  


  * Weekly: review **Call Logs** , disposition usage, IVR no-input rates, and contacts with **Inbound DND (Calls)**.

  * Adjust prompts/timeouts and retrain agents as needed.


  

    
    
    **Note:** if your own numbers are being labeled “spam likely”: that’s a separate, outbound reputation issue. see related articles for remediation via caller reputation best practices and free caller registry steps.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Will Number Intelligence automatically block calls?**

No. It provides “Spam Likely” signals. Blocking behavior comes from your workflows (e.g., DND) and/or IVR design.

  


**Q: Should I set DND to “All channels”?**

Start with **Inbound + Voice**. Expanding to all channels risks suppressing legitimate SMS/email. Increase scope only if spam persists.

  


**Q: How do I avoid blocking VIPs or important vendors?**

Use a **VIP/SafeList** tag and add an **If/Else** condition to skip DND and bypass IVR for those contacts.

  


**Q: What if an agent marks a real customer as “Spam call”?**

Remove DND on the contact record (or let your auto-clear workflow lift DND after X days). You can also log a note and add the VIP tag.

  


**Q: Can I send spam-labeled calls straight to voicemail?**

Yes. Route via IVR timeout/invalid or add a workflow branch that sends **Inbound, Voice** to voicemail when disposition = Spam call.

  


**Q: Does this impact outbound dialing?**

DND settings configured for **Inbound** do not block your outbound calls to that contact. Choose Direction and Channels intentionally.

  


**Q: Can I filter SMS spam, too?**

You can apply DND to additional **Channels** (e.g., SMS). Evaluate impact first; consider separate logic for SMS vs Voice.

  


**Q: Is IVR required?**

No. IVR is optional. Many businesses rely on Number Intelligence + Disposition → DND only, especially in urgent-response use cases.
