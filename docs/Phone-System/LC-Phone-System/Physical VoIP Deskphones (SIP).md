**_Step 3:_**_SIP User_

**_Step 4:_**_Assign User_

  


Each VoIP deskphone needs to be connected to a user in your sub-account. Select one user from the Assign to User dropdown.

  


Make sure the user's individual phone settings are configured to use deskphone. Navigate to**Settings > My Staff > Choose staff > Edit > Call & Voicemail Settings**, please enable "Deskphone" for the options you need. Enable it for "Forward Calls to" to receive calls addressed to you on the Deskphone. If you're receiving calls as part of "Ring multiple", and you want to receive them on the deskphone, enable Deskphone under "Ring all".  
  
If the user sets Default channel for IVR = Deskphone, IVR-routed calls will ring the deskphone.

**Deskphone to deskphone transfer**

  


## **1\. Direct Extension Dialing Between Deskphones******

You can now call any teammate with a configured deskphone simply by dialing their extension.

### What’s New?

If your teammate’s extension is **101** , just dial **201** from your deskphone to connect instantly , no external numbers or additional routing required.

### Key Details

  * Fast extension-to-extension calling

  * Works between configured deskphones

  * Supported on deskphones only


This update makes internal communication quicker and more efficient for teams using deskphones.

## **2\. IVR Call Transfer Between Deskphones**

**You can now transfer IVR calls from one deskphone directly to another deskphone.**

  


**How it works?**

During an active IVR call on your deskphone:

  1. Initiate a transfer.

  2. Dial your teammate’s extension.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Which VoIP deskphones are compatible?**  
Most open-SIP models—see the recommended list above.

  


****Q:** Can I record and transcribe every call?**  
Yes. Once enabled, all calls are automatically recorded and transcribed.

  


****Q:** How do I perform a blind transfer during a call?**  
Use the **Blind Transfer** option on your deskphone UI.

  


****Q:** Is there an extra charge for using deskphones?**  
No. Deskphone calls share the same per-minute rates as web/mobile calls. There is no additional cost for the call transfer to a deskphone.

  


****Q:** Can two deskphones point at the same HighLevel user?**  
No, you can only connect a single user to each VoIP deskphone.

  


****Q:** Do you support SIP Trunking?**  
No, we do not support SIP Trunking as of now. So you cannot connect your existing PBX/Asterix to GHL as of now.

  


****Q:** Why am I not able to receive the incoming call on my deskphone?**  
Make sure the user's individual phone settings are deskphone. Navigate to **Settings > My Staff > Choose staff > Edit > Call & Voicemail Settings**, please enable **"Deskphone"** for the options you need.

  


**Q: Can I place callers on hold with music from a deskphone?**

Music played during a _handset_ Hold depends on your SIP phone model and its local Hold behavior. HighLevel does **not** control music-on-hold triggered by a device’s Hold button. If you want callers to hear audio while they wait _inside a call flow_ , use an **IVR** step with an audio prompt in your workflow.

See **__[Interactive Voice Response (IVR)](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000001200>)__ **for more information.

  


**Q: Can I transfer a call to another user’s extension from a deskphone? Are extensions visible on the phone?**

Yes—supported SIP handsets can perform a **blind transfer** to another user’s extension. **Warm transfer** is **not** supported as of now. Showing other users/extensions on the deskphone screen is not supported as of now.

For assisted transfers on the web, see **_[_Outbound Calls with the Web Dialer_](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48000981431>)_**.

  


**Q: Can I check HighLevel voicemail from the deskphone’s voicemail button?**

Voicemails that route to HighLevel are reviewed in **Conversations** and in **Reporting → Call Reporting**. A phone’s native voicemail feature (if present) is separate and does **not** access HighLevel voicemail.

See _[**_Voicemail for Company and for Users_**](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001146671>)_**** for more information.

  


**Q: Is there a single place to review all call recordings?**

Yes. Use **Reporting → Call Reporting** for a consolidated list of calls and recordings. You can also open recordings from each contact’s **Conversations** thread. IVR-connected calls may include multiple recordings for different call legs.

  


**Q: Are there known compatibility issues with certain SIP deskphones?**

Most open-SIP phones work when standard SIP registration is supported. Ensure network prerequisites are met (e.g., disable SIP ALG; allow SIP/RTP). If you’re unsure, share your handset **make/model and firmware** so we can point you to the best approach.

  


**Q: Do you have configuration blueprints or model-specific setup guides?**

Follow the steps in this article to create the SIP user/extension, then enter those credentials in your phone’s SIP account fields (commonly: **SIP URI** , **Username/Extension** , **Authentication/Password**). If you provide your phone model, we can share the most relevant instructions.  
  


  


**Q: I’m able to make outbound calls, but inbound calls are not working properly. What should I check?**

If outbound calls are working but inbound calls are not, we recommend checking the **Keep Alive** setting. Please ensure that Keep Alive is enabled and set to**_Options_**. If it hasn’t been configured yet, updating this setting often resolves inbound call issues.  
  
You can update this setting by navigating to **Account → Advanced → Keep Alive Type**.
