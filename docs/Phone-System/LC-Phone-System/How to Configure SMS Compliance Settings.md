# **What is SMS Compliance Settings?**

  


SMS Compliance Settings ensure that outbound SMS messages meet carrier and policy expectations by automatically appending **opt‑out language** (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe”) and **sender identification** (e.g., “Thanks, Alex at Main Street Dental”) when those elements are missing. Enabling these controls protects deliverability, reduces filtering risk, and supports a consistent, compliant experience.

## **Key Benefits of SMS Compliance Settings**

  


Understanding the value makes adoption easy. These benefits map directly to carrier guidelines and practical day‑to‑day messaging needs.  
  


  * **Compliance-by-default** : Automatically appends sender ID and opt‑out language to the first message when missing.  
  


  * **Reduced carrier filtering** : Adds the elements carriers expect, lowering the chance of messages being blocked.  
  


  * **Brand clarity** : **Sender identification** helps recipients recognize who is texting them, improving trust and reply rates.  
  


  * **Automated cadence** : Every‑X‑days control re‑inserts sender ID + opt‑out on a schedule (e.g., every 30 days) to maintain ongoing compliance.  
  


  * **De‑duplication** : Prevents duplicate opt‑out text when you already include it in your message template.

## **Tips, Guidelines & Rules**

  


  * The first message in any SMS conversation (including **Missed Call Text Back** and **review requests**) will always include both of the following. Example: _“Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”_  
  

  * The **Opt Out** message will only be added if it is not already included in the message.  
  

  * **Agencies in Trial Mode** cannot disable these checkboxes.  
  

  * **Locations/sub-accounts** created within the last **15 days** cannot disable these checkboxes.  
  

  * **Account Users and Admins** cannot disable these checkboxes.  
  

  * Strong, simple wording improves deliverability and avoids content that may be flagged by carriers.*  
  


  * Sender ID examples: _“Thanks, Jamie at Oak & Co.”_ or _“—Team Acme Fitness.”_  
  


  * Avoid spammy formatting, excessive emojis, URL shorteners, and vague brand references.


###   
**Defaults & Behavior****  
**

**  
**

  * **New sub-accounts:** Enabled by default.  
  


  * **Existing sub-accounts:** Disabled by default.  
  


  * **First outbound message:** Sender info and opt-out language are always included on the first outbound message in a conversation, even if periodic insertion is disabled.


###   
**Smart detection (opt-out suppression)**

  


  * The system suppresses re-insertion only when it detects a **full opt-out phrase** in your message (for example, an unsubscribe instruction), not when it sees a single keyword in normal context.  
  


  * Single words like “stop” inside regular sentences do **not** prevent sender info/opt-out insertion.  
Examples of phrases that should suppress insertion (if already present):  
  


  * “Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”  
  


  * “Text STOP to opt out.”  
  


  * “Reply STOP to end.”  
  
Non-suppression example: “If this time doesn’t work, stop by tomorrow.”

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Can I disable sender ID or opt‑out language?**  
If you’re in trial mode, managing a location less than 15 days old, or have restricted user permissions, you may not be able to disable these options. HighLevel recommends keeping them enabled to maintain compliance.

  


**Q: What happens if my message already has opt‑out language?**  
A: HighLevel won’t add duplicate opt‑out text; it only appends the required line if it’s missing.

  


**Q: How do I customize the opt‑out or sender text?**  
A: Edit the text fields next to each control (or click **Customize** , if shown) in the SMS Compliance tab. Use clear, concise wording (e.g., “Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”).

  


**Q: What words are carrier compliant for out-out message?**

STOP, STOPALL, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, END, or QUIT.
