Missed Call Text Back — Overview & Setup

Automatically text back every missed caller — and now, send from an eligible number even when the number they called can’t send SMS.

Overview

A missed call can be a missed opportunity. HighLevel’s Missed Call Text Back feature automatically sends a text message to callers you weren’t able to reach, so every inbound call gets acknowledged right away — even after hours.

In this article, we’ll walk through what the feature does, how to set it up, how voicemail settings work alongside it, and how HighLevel now picks the best eligible number to send your follow-up from.

What’s New

Your missed call text back now has a better chance of reaching the customer. If the number they called can’t send SMS, HighLevel automatically selects an eligible sending number instead of letting the follow-up fail. See Smarter Sending Number Selection.

Important

Missed Call Text Back triggers an SMS notification for **every** missed call — even if the same caller tries multiple times within a brief timeframe.

To avoid sending multiple messages for repeated missed calls, we recommend you [create and customize the existing recipe in Workflows](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwvCPUxgMaM>) and personalize it to your preference (for example, add a 20 +/− minute Wait step, or filter using tags such as 1st call, 2nd call, and so on).

## What is Missed Call Text Back?

Missed Call Text Back is a feature that automatically sends a text message to a caller when their inbound call is missed. It helps your business acknowledge the missed call right away, set expectations, and encourage the caller to continue the conversation by text while your team is unavailable.

This feature is especially helpful for businesses that receive after-hours calls, handle a high volume of inbound calls, or want a faster first response without relying on a manual callback process.

Why This Matters

When someone calls your business and you can’t answer, that first follow-up can be the difference between a booked appointment and a lost lead. An automatic text keeps the conversation alive without anyone lifting a finger.

## Key Benefits of Missed Call Text Back

**Faster follow-up** — send an automatic text to missed callers right away so they know their call was noticed.

**Better customer experience** — a quick response reassures callers and gives them another way to continue the conversation.

**More personalization** — use merge fields to include details like the contact name or business name in your message.

**Simple setup** — enable the feature, customize the message, send a test, and save your changes.

**Improved lead response** — keep potential leads engaged when your team is unavailable to answer.

**Higher delivery success** — HighLevel automatically picks an eligible sending number so more follow-ups actually go out.

Step 2

Navigate to Missed Call Text Back

Follow this path inside Settings:

  * In the left-side menu, click **Phone System**.
  * In the top navigation, click **Voice**.
  * Under Voice, open **Voicemail & Missed Call Text Back**.
  * In the side panel, click **Missed Call Text Back**.

Step 3

Enable the feature

Select the checkbox to **Enable Missed Call Text Back** to turn the feature on. Then click **Customize** to tailor the message that goes out when someone misses you.

![Enable Missed Call Text Back checkbox with the Customize button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155066735467/original/4EWpJaWoQ9luC5sgv6_WANHjVeaO3_e4jA.png?1773266017)

Step 4

Customize the message

Clicking **Customize** opens a pop-up where you can craft your automated response. In the **Enter message** field, type the content you want sent when a call is missed.

You can also use the custom value tag icon to insert dynamic placeholders such as the contact’s name. Keep in mind that these only work if the system already recognizes the contact from a prior interaction.

Step 5

Send a test message

Below the message editor you’ll find a field where you can send a test message. Select the number you’d like to use to preview how the message will appear to customers.

After reviewing, click **Save** to finalize your settings and activate the updated Missed Call Text Back configuration.

You’re All Set

Missed Call Text Back is now live. The next time an inbound call goes unanswered past your ring timeout, the caller receives your message automatically.

## Voicemail Settings

Voicemail settings shape what happens when an inbound call is not answered. These options let you control how long the phone rings before voicemail triggers, and optionally replace the default voicemail greeting with a custom recording.

Setting 1

Adjust the incoming call timeout

This option sets how long the phone should ring before the missed call text back triggers. Use the slider to choose a timeout duration — 10 to 20 seconds is typically recommended.

![Incoming call timeout slider in voicemail settings](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155066036199/original/NTcwyGYzj0J8NJgwbl1AhEdPpRwY4k4xBA.png?1772475723)

Setting 2 · Optional

Upload a voicemail audio file

You can add a custom voicemail message here if you’d like. Upload a pre-recorded file in mp3, wav, or a similar format. This plays instead of the carrier’s generic voicemail greeting.

![Upload voicemail audio file option in voicemail settings](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155066036213/original/375vNtucIblJVv2XLsfRPNTC-B-cJAWcJw.png?1772475746)

Note

The call timeout you set here determines when a call counts as “missed.” A very long timeout delays the text back; a very short one may cut off callers who would have answered.

## Smarter Sending Number Selection

A missed call can be a missed opportunity — and your follow-up text shouldn’t fail simply because the number your customer called can’t send SMS.

What Changed

**Previously:** Missed Call Text Back always tried to send the follow-up SMS from the same number your customer called. Some numbers are designed primarily to receive calls, or may not currently be eligible to send SMS — so your text back could fail even when another messaging-ready number was available in your account.

**Now:** HighLevel automatically chooses an eligible sending number, helping more of your missed call follow-ups reach your customers while staying aligned with messaging requirements.

### How the sending number is chosen

When a customer calls and you miss them, we’ll still try to text them back from **the number they called first** , as long as that number can send SMS. If it can’t, the system automatically looks for the next best option in this order:

Priority| Number used to send the text back  
---|---  
1| The number the customer called — if it is eligible to send SMS  
2| A number you’ve **successfully messaged this contact from before**  
3| Your **default outbound number**  
4| Another **eligible messaging number** available in the location  
  
Where This Helps Most

This is especially useful when calls come through **number pools, call tracking numbers, unverified toll-free numbers, or other numbers that aren’t eligible to send SMS**. Instead of attempting the text from a number that can’t send, we use an eligible number when one is available.

### What will you notice?

Most of the time, nothing changes — the missed caller simply receives your follow-up as expected.

Heads Up

In some cases the **SMS may come from a different number than the one they originally called**. That’s intentional — we choose a number that can actually send the message rather than letting an important follow-up fail.

### Why it matters

With smarter number selection, you can:

**Reach more missed callers** instead of losing the follow-up because one number can’t send SMS.

**Keep follow-ups automatic** without manually managing which number should be used.

**Stay aligned with messaging requirements** such as A2P and toll-free verification.

**Respond to potential leads sooner** and keep conversations moving even when you miss the initial call.

The Payoff

In short: if you have an eligible number available, we’ll automatically use it to give your missed call text a better chance of reaching the customer.

Good to Know

  * Answered calls continue to work as before and will not trigger a text back.
  * If **Missed Call Text Back** is disabled in your Phone System settings, no message will be sent.
  * Your contacts’ communication preferences and DND settings continue to be respected.
  * If there is no eligible number available, you’ll see the failed attempt in the conversation along with the reason, giving you clear visibility into what happened.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What number is used to send the missed call text back message?

We first try the number the customer called, as long as it’s eligible to send SMS. If it isn’t, HighLevel automatically falls back to a number you’ve successfully messaged this contact from before, then your default outbound number, then any other eligible messaging number in the location. See Smarter Sending Number Selection for the full order.

Q: Why did my missed call text come from a different number?

That’s expected behavior. The number the caller dialed most likely can’t send SMS — for example a number pool number, a call tracking number, or an unverified toll-free number — so we used an eligible number instead of letting the follow-up fail.

Q: What happens if no eligible sending number is available?

The attempt is logged in the contact’s conversation along with the reason it failed, so you have clear visibility. To fix it, make sure at least one number in the location is verified and eligible to send SMS (**A2P 10DLC** registration for local numbers, or toll-free verification for toll-free numbers).

Q: Do Missed Call Text Back messages count toward messaging limits?

Yes. These SMS messages count toward your phone messaging usage limits.

Q: Will a text be sent if the contact is on DND?

No. Your contacts’ communication preferences and DND settings are always respected, regardless of which sending number would have been selected.

Q: Do I need to change any settings to get smarter number selection?

No. There’s nothing to enable. As long as Missed Call Text Back is turned on in **Settings → Phone System → Voice** , the improved number selection applies automatically.

Q: Can I use WhatsApp instead of SMS for missed call follow-up?

Not with the SMS-based Missed Call Text Back feature. If you want to message missed callers through WhatsApp instead, use the separate [Missed Call WhatsApp Back](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002417>) feature in HighLevel.

Q: Does Missed Call Text Back work for after-hours calls?

Yes. This feature is especially useful for after-hours missed calls because it automatically acknowledges the caller and gives them a way to continue the conversation by text even when your team is unavailable.

Q: Will an answered call still trigger a text back?

No. Only calls that go unanswered past your incoming call timeout are treated as missed. Answered calls never trigger a text back.
