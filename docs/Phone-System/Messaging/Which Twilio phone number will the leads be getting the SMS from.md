**Primary Rule**  
  
1.If the staff member sending the SMS is listed under the sub-account’s **My Staff** tab **and** has a **dedicated Twilio number assigned** :  
➝ The lead will receive the SMS from that assigned Twilio number.(It can be changed manually)  
2.**Exception:** If the assigned Twilio number is SMS-incompatible, the system will fall back to the **default outbound number**.  
3.If user is selecting the number from which he wants to send the messages manually,the system will display the **last used number next time.**

## **Workflow Settings Option**

Inside the **Workflow builder** , you can also **manually choose which number to send SMS from**.

  * When configuring a **“Send SMS” step** , you’ll see a dropdown for **“From Number.”**


This is useful when you want workflows to always send from a particular number, regardless of staff assignment or channel number.

## **Fallback Rules (When No User Number Exists)**

If the User logged into HighLevel is **not listed in the sub-account** , or **doesn’t have a LC number assigned** , the system will try the following in order:

  1. **Channel Number** – the **first LC number ever used with that contact**.

     * This maintains conversation continuity.  
  


  2. **Default Outbound Number** – if the channel number has been removed, the system will use the **default Twilio number** set at the account level.


* * *

## **Checking Which Number Was Used**

To confirm the exact Twilio number used in a conversation:

  * Hover over the **SMS message** in the conversation view.

  * Click the **three dots (…) > Details**.

  * This will show the **Twilio number** used to send that SMS.
