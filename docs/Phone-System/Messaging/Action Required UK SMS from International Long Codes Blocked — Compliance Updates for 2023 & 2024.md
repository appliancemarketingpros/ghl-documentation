### **Overview**

  


If you send SMS messages to UK mobile numbers, your deliverability and compliance are at risk unless you update your sender types. Starting **June 1, 2023** , UK carriers began **blocking international long codes** for Application-to-Person (A2P) traffic. In **2024** , further regulatory requirements have been introduced for **UK long codes themselves**.

## **What Changed in 2023**

  * **Carrier Blocking of International Long Codes**  
From June 1, 2023, UK network operators started blocking SMS from **non-UK long codes**. These numbers were originally designed for Person-to-Person (P2P) use, but many businesses were using them for A2P traffic, which carriers now classify as **abuse of P2P routes**.

  * **Impact** : Any SMS sent to UK recipients from an international long code is likely to fail.

## **What’s Changing in 2024**

Twilio and UK regulators have layered on stricter compliance requirements:

  1. **Regulatory Compliance Bundles (RC bundles)**

     * From **May 27, 2024** , all new UK long codes require an **approved RC bundle** before they can send SMS or make calls.

     * From **September 30, 2024** , _all_ UK long codes (new or old) must have an approved RC bundle.

  2. **Know Your Customer (KYC)**  
Businesses must provide documentation to verify their identity and intended use case before using UK long codes.

  3. **Full Enforcement of Blocking**  
By mid-2024, all UK carriers had aligned to enforce these rules. Traffic from international long codes is universally blocked, and unregistered UK long codes will also fail.

## **What You Need to Do**

### Step 1. Stop Using International Long Codes

  * If you are still sending SMS from non-UK numbers to UK recipients, switch immediately.


### Step 2. Use Approved Sender Types

  * **UK Long Code (Local Number)** — Requires KYC and regulatory approval.

  * **Alphanumeric Sender ID** — For one-way traffic, brand your sender name (e.g., _YourCompany_).

  * **Short Code** — For higher-volume or two-way messaging, apply for a UK short code (12–16 weeks provisioning).


### Step 3. Register Your Numbers

  * Submit your **Regulatory Compliance (RC) bundle** in Twilio Console.

  * Provide the necessary KYC documents (business name, address, use case, etc.).


### Step 4. Monitor Message Logs

  * In Twilio Console, use **Messaging Insights** to filter:

    * “From Country ≠ UK” and “To Country = UK” → find non-compliant traffic.

  * Look for blocked or undelivered messages and update routing.
