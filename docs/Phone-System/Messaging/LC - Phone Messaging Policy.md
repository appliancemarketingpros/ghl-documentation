**To protect agencies' SMS reputation and limit exposure, we have implemented the**below features** available in ****[**LC - Phone System ONLY!**](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204027>)**

  
This messaging policy applies to _all subaccounts_ that are using**LC - Phone** for communication within the CRM.  
  
We all expect that the messages we want to receive will reach us, unhindered by filtering or other blockers. An important step that LC - Phone and our customers can take to make that expectation a reality is to prevent and eliminate unwanted messages.  
  
We make sure that the messages sent through LC - Phone are to consenting parties and follow applicable laws, industry standards, and guidelines. We also want to be mindful of measures of fairness and decency when in doubt.

# **LC - Phone Messaging Policy**

  
 _All messaging_ transmitted via the platform - regardless of use case or phone number type (e.g., long code, or toll-free) - need to comply with the Application-to-Person (A2P) messaging. All A2P messages originating from the system are subject to this Messaging Policy, which covers messaging rules and /or prohibitions regarding:  
  


  * **Consent (“opt-in”):** Consent can't be bought, sold, or exchanged. For example, you can't obtain the consent of message recipients by purchasing a phone list from another party. And SMS should only be sent to the opted-in contacts.  
  

  * **Revocation of Consent (“opt-out”):** The initial message that you send to an individual needs to include the following language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe,” or the equivalent so that Individuals have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword.  
  

  * **Sender Identification:** Every initial message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation.  
  

  * **Messaging Usage:** You should not be sending messages in any way related to alcohol, firearms, gambling, tobacco, or other adult content.  
  

  * **Filtering Evasion:** As noted above, we do not allow content that has been specifically designed to evade detection by unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms. This includes intentionally misspelled words or non-standard opt-out phrases which have been specifically created with the intent to evade these mechanisms. We do not permit snowshoeing, which is defined as spreading similar or identical messages across many phone numbers with the intent or effect of evading unwanted messaging detection and prevention mechanisms.


  
This policy applies to all customers who use LC - Phone messaging services to safeguard their messaging capabilities and services.

  
  


* * *

## **How We Handle Violations?**

  
When we identify a violation of these principles, where possible, we will work with customers in good faith to get them back into compliance with the messaging policy. However, to protect the continued ability of all our customers to freely use messaging for legitimate purposes, we reserve the right to _suspend or remove access to the platform for customers or customers’ end users’ that we determine are not complying with the Messaging Policy_ , or who are not following the law in any applicable area or applicable communications industry guidelines or standards, in some instances with limited notice in the case of serious violations of this policy.

# **1\. SMS Ramp-Up Model (V2):**

  
Starting February 1st, 2024, all the sub-accounts created under LC Phone will have an 8-level ramp instead of the 7-day ramp with a lower limit. Below is the table which will give you a detailed idea of the ramp: 

  


  


Level| SMS   
Sending Limit  
---|---  
1| 100  
2| 250  
3| 500  
4| 750  
5| 1500  
6| 2250  
7| 3000  
8| 3000+  
  
  


  


**How it Works:**

  

    
    
    **This ramp will not start on the signup date.** In contrast, it will start on the day when the first successful SMS message is sent. 

  


  1. All Sub-Accounts start at Level 1, enabling them to send 100 SMS within 24 hours.  
  

  2. To increase sending limits, the Sub-Account must send the full level sending limit within a 24-hour window.  
  

  3. After sending the full level sending limit within 24 hours, the Sub-Account will be temporarily restricted from sending SMS for the next 24 hours. During this temporary restriction, SMS sending is disabled.  
  

  4. After the 24 hours, the temporary restriction will be removed. The Sub-Account will be able to send messages again and the Sub-Account will unlock the next level sending limit, increasing their sending limit.


  


**An example**  
  


  * A new Sub-Account will start on Level 1 Sending Limits of 100 SMS within 24 hours.  
  

  * To unlock Level 2, A Sub-Account must send 100 SMS within 24 hours.   
  

  * After sending 100 SMS within 24 hours, the Sub-Account will be temporarily restricted from sending SMS for 24 hours. After 24 hours, SMS sending will be allowed again and you will unlock Level 2 sending limit of 250.   
  

  * Then to unlock Level 3, you must send 250 SMS within 24 hours, after sending 250 SMS within 24 hours you will be temporarily restricted from sending SMS for 24 hours. After 24 hours, you will unlock Level 3 sending limit of 500.   
  

  * This process of hitting the level sending limit and waiting 24 hours, continues until Level 8, which allows for 3000+ sending.


  


**FAQs on SMS Ramp**  
  


  * **Can I change or Remove this Ramp Up Model?****  
**No. Previously we had an option for the agency to change the SMS limit within the ramp or post ramp period. That capability has been taken away.  
  

  * **Do one-to-one and Missed Call Text Back SMS count toward my daily limit sending?****  
**Yes. Previously one-to-one messages and Missed Call Text Back messages were not considered as part of the day’s total message, this will be counted henceforth.  
  

  * **Can I send one-to-one messages during the 24-hour temporary sending restriction after reaching my level limit?****  
**No. Previously, when a location was restricted temporarily the one-to-one messages used to be allowed, we have taken that capability away.


  


## **Why the change?**

  


LC - Phone policy was implemented to:  
  


  1. Avoid SMS Spam blasts from fake signups. New sub-accounts on LC - Phone will follow the Ramp-Up Model  
  

  2. Avoid getting sub-accounts blocked due to suspicious activity  
  

  3. Avoid legal actions due to increased spamming to non-consenting customers. Only bulk SMS sending will have daily limitations to avoid sub-account suspension due to non-compliant messaging activity.


  


### **What error screens or notifications will a sub-account see during a violation?**  
  


  1. **Conversation Error:** You have exceeded your SMS sending limit.  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48222961915/original/2QKxVz00B7OVVQAHVK3y2npqoXsM7NyViA.png?1651581300)  
  
  

  2. **Bulk Action:** You are allowed to send 5000 message(s) in a day. You have already sent 5000 message(s). If you wish to proceed, 1 Message(s) will be failed.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/48222962001/original/CJSFxDMFuf9RF8nd-vVYLdPc6GDRw2W76w.png?1651581314)

# **2****. Spam Message Handling:**  
  


Each of the messages sent out from the sub-account ends up with the following 4 statuses:  
  


  1. **Sent** : The messages whose response we did not receive from the carrier, can be in any of the three statuses below.  
  

  2. **Delivered** : The messages which were successfully delivered and sent to the contact.  
  

  3. **Failed** : The messages which were canceled or were not sent to the carrier to forward to the contact.  
  

  4. **Undelivered** : The message sent was suspicious or did not fulfill the messaging policy.


  


As part of this feature, we will only consider Undelivered messages. All the undelivered messages end up with a particular error code and we will start storing them at each of the message levels. We will further use them to start enabling Temporary/Permanent DND at a contact level so that new SMSs' are not sent to them increasing your deliverability rate. 

  
The below table summarizes the undelivered SMS error codes and what each of them means and the relevant remediation measure we are taking:

  


**Response Code**| **Code Description**| **Remediation**  
---|---|---  
30005| User Inactive/Number does not exist| Enable Temporary DND  
30003| Unreachable- Out of Service| Enable Temporary DND  
30004| Do not want SMS/DND enabled| Enable Permanent DND  
30006| Landline/Incapable to receive SMS| Enable Temporary DND  
30008| None of the above scenarios matched| Do nothing  
  
  


** _Temporary DND:_**_The DND set at a contact level can be revoked by the agency or location._

**_Permanent DND:_**_The DND set at the contact level cannot be revoked by the agency or the location as the contact is incapable to receive the message or had opted out from receiving messages._

_**Opt-Out Keyword:**__Individuals must have the ability to revoke consent at any time by replying with a standard opt-out keyword like STOP, Unsubscribe, etc. In this case, also a permanent DND will be enabled at the contact level._

  


### **Advantage:**  
  


  * This will restrict the location from sending SMS to non-relevant contacts, eventually increasing the deliverability rate and decreasing the possibility of getting blocked.  
  

  * The locations will only send out messages to the contacts who have opted in.


##   


## **Spam messaging error screens:**  
  


  1. **Conversation:** Cannot send messages as DND is active for SMS.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053452149/original/MCPIyZBNxEMDLfROubCaT6EVYvv-erzHgQ.png?1757496520)  

  2. **Bulk Action:** All SMS sent via features like workflow, and bulk SMS will automatically skip the DND-marked contacts from the sender list.


* * *

## **How to revoke the DND for a contact?**  
  


  1. **For Temporary DND,** go to the contact details and remove the DND flag, below is the screenshot of the sample screen:  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053452338/original/djBu37YNnY_M087ZaisF71IYZXVxBWlBRA.png?1757496591)  

  2. **For Permanent DND,** you cannot revoke the same from UI. To revoke the permanent DND, request the contact to send a reply with the "START", "YES", and "UNSTOP" keywords to the number. This should automatically remove the DND from the contract.


  
**Please Note:**  
  

    
    
     If the START keyword does not revoke the DND and still incoming/outgoing messages are failing, please raise a support ticket.

* * *

# **3\. Opt-Out Language addition**

  


  * The consent for sending out communications cannot be bought and the only way is to take explicit consent from the user for the SMS campaigns and communications.  
  

  * The consent is taken by a specific entity, in our case sub-accounts that are the actual sender of these communications.  
  

  * To comply with the messaging policies each of the initial messages sent out by the company to an end-user should have below two mandatory information, ie, Sender ID and opt-out Language:  
  

  * **Opt-Out Language:** The end user should have the capability to remove the consent at any time, so similar to above each initial message should also have opt-out keywords like STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, etc. We will additionally add the opt-out language: “Reply STOP to unsubscribe".


  


**Please note:**  
  

    
    
    The "Opt out message" setting will apply SMS messages sent using these methods **if it is the first SMS message being sent to a new contact and that contact has never sent an SMS message to your system phone number:**  
    1. A Bulk Action in the Contacts area of the app (i.e. when selecting multiple contacts and choosing the "Send SMS" button in the top toolbar  
    2. Workflow "Send SMS" Actions   
    3. Campaigns (legacy feature)   
    4. One-on-One messages sent via the Conversations area of the app

###   
**Sample Opt-Out Language message screen:**  
**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053453499/original/QjJraDPQbBjkiFGdJqmioh3v3Rm-P-b_9w.png?1757497254)**

  


  


## **How can I customize the opt-out message?**

  
Go to **Sub-account** -> **Settings** -> phone numbers -> advanced setting -> sms complaince where you can customize the opt-out message, below is the screenshot for reference:  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053453762/original/-GbEFXZQWEdvoFpHxolBlf7ptBnchqL_JA.png?1757497403)![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053454589/original/gDvz85IoJrfz0wAcKas2Ug3-vUZNGpyHXg.png?1757497788)

###   
**What happens if my message already has opt-out language?**

The platform suppresses the auto-added opt-out line only when it detects a **full opt-out instruction** already included in the message (for example, an unsubscribe phrase). It does not suppress insertion for incidental keywords used in normal sentences.

  
**Examples (suppresses insertion if already present):**

  * “Reply STOP to unsubscribe.”  
  


  * “Text STOP to opt out.”  
  


  * “Reply STOP to end.”


  
**Non-suppression example (does not suppress):**

  * “If you want to stop by the office tomorrow, we’re open 9–5.”  
  
  
**What happens when an end-user replies with the STOP keyword?**


  


If individuals reply with a standard opt-out keyword like **STOP** , the consent to send SMS will be revoked. All upcoming and queued messages will be failed. Also, a **permanent DND** will be enabled at the contact level.

  
**Please Note:**
    
    
     This is mandatory info that should be shared with the end customer so this is a mandatory check for all the initial messages.
    
    The **first outbound message** in a conversation must include **sender identification and opt-out language** , regardless of other settings.

#   


* * *

# **4.****Sender Information addition**  
  


  * The consent for sending out communications cannot be bought and the only way is to take explicit consent from the user for the SMS campaigns and communications.  
  

  * The consent is taken by a specific entity, in our case locations that are the actual sender of these communications.  
  

  * To comply with the messaging policies each of the initial messages sent out by the company to an end-user should have below two mandatory information, ie, **Sender ID** and **opt-out Language** :  
  

  * **SenderID:** Every message you send must clearly identify you (the party that obtained the opt-in from the recipient) as the sender, except in follow-up messages of an ongoing conversation. We will additionally add the sender info: “Thanks, <Location Name>".


  


**Please note:**  
  

    
    
     “**Sender ID** ” feature is applicable to all **Bulk action**(Bulk SMS)**, Workflows, campaigns** and to One on One conversation.

  
  


### **Sample message screen:**

* * *

## **How can I customize the Sender ID?**

  
Go to **Sub-account** -> **Settings** -> phone numbers -> advanced setting -> sms compliance where you can customize the Sender ID message, below is the screenshot for reference:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155053454545/original/Zw_-iAF7hig8ZzQOpJgQXoU359UxdrUTmw.png?1757497773)

  
  
**Please Note:**  
  

    
    
     This is mandatory info that should be shared with the end customer so this is a mandatory check for all the initial messages.

* * *

### **5\. Error and Opt-Out Rate Monitoring**

We are committed to helping our customers deliver trusted and compliant communications. To prevent carriers from blocking or permanently suspending accounts due to poor usage patterns, we actively monitor messaging performance and take proactive measures to maintain healthy delivery rates.

  


We monitor the overall delivery performance of each account and apply corrective actions (as outlined below) to keep delivery rates within acceptable limits.

###   
**_Opt-Out and Bounce Rate Monitoring_**

Below is the chart outlining the opt-out and bounce rate thresholds at which **Warnings (W)** and **Suspensions (S)** are triggered.

  


#### **1\. Locations Following Ramp-Up**

This table defines when a warning or suspension is applied based on:

  * Location level L1,L2 (represents the ramp level the location is on)

  * Number of SMS messages sent

  * Opt-out count or opt-out percentage  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064877368/original/OvB291-hgT9EZ4nieVtbZ8Cr7uAKMnqPuQ.png?1770991583)


#### **2\. Locations Created Before 4th February 2024 and locations Following Messaging Limits**

This table specifies when warning or suspension emails are triggered based on:

  * Total SMS messages sent

  * Bounce count or bounce percentage![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064876943/original/BgSXd43w2xWGD_osl4Be55xDFmFG-J4zXQ.png?1770991257)


  


### ** _Error Rate Monitoring_**

Below is the chart outlining the error rate thresholds at which **Warnings (W)** and **Suspensions (S)** are triggered.

  


#### **1\. Locations Following Ramp-Up**

This table defines when a warning or suspension is applied based on:

  * Location level L1,L2(represents the ramp level the location is on)

  * Number of SMS messages sent

  * Error count or error percentage  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064877313/original/WtJjrAfPV7lqjNAVfjoY4jiMir6kuMccqg.png?1770991562)


  


#### **2\. Locations Created Before 4th February 2024 and Following Messaging Limits**

This table specifies when warning or suspension emails are triggered based on:

  * Total SMS messages sent

  * Error count or error percentage  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064160668/original/Ex2774QQ4U7izMtOPXbkRmKzAnAdyHzWvA.png?1770200827)


  
**Note:**  
Locations created before **4th February 2024** did not follow the ramp-up process and were placed directly on messaging limits.

**Important:**  
Once an account enters **temporary suspension** , all outbound SMS messages will fail until **00:00 AM UTC** , when the suspension is automatically lifted.

  


###   
**What should we do when we get a violation email?**  
  


  1. ### 

Stop all your workflows, campaigns, triggers, and/or bulk actions to contacts who have not explicitly opted in to receive messages from the sub-account.  
  


  2. Enable and customize the Opt Out language and SenderID message as per your use case so that all the upcoming messages are not flagged.  
  

  3. Please discuss this with your client to make no bulk communication or messages blast or cold prospecting message campaigns are sent in the near future before we receive your reply to this ticket.


###   
**What are error and opt-out rates are good to have a threshold?**  
  


  * A **High Opt-Out Rate** indicates that contacts receiving your messages have objected, generated complaints, or marked your SMS as spam. **A good opt-out rate is typically in the range of 0—1%.**  
  

  * A **High Delivery Error Rate** indicates that you are sending SMS to contacts that are no longer in service, are unreachable, or use a non-SMS-capable device such as a landline. This may also mean that external carrier filters are refusing to deliver your SMS due to bad sending behavior in the past.   


###   
**What do I do to get the subaccount suspension removed early?**  


  * The subaccount suspension will be lifted in 24 hours. However, if the sub-account is permanently suspended. Please refer to the article [Why is your account suspended](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001207676>) to unsuspend the sub-account.  
  
**Please Note:**


    
    
     One on One conversation, Test SMS, Resend Message, and MissedCallTextBack are allowed even if the account is suspended.

* * *

# **Frequently Asked Questions**  
  


**Q1. I'd like to send more than 5000 SMS per day, how can I increase my limit?**

Once your location(s) hit the 8th-day mark (3000+ SMS per day), you may [reach out to support](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001204857>) and request a Limit extension. 

  


**Q2.What happens when we hit our daily limit, will we be able to respond to SMS if a lead replies?**

No, you cannot respond manually to incoming messages. SMS daily limits will affect all messaging activities including manual SMS in conversation, automation within workflows, and bulk actions.

  


**Q3.How often does the SMS limit last?**

The SMS limit will refresh every 24 hours. If the account is brand new then each day the increments wil

increase according to the table above. Once you have hit the 8th day your SMS limit will be capped at 3000+ per day.

  


**Q4.Can we undo the DND option in bulk?**

No, we cannot because this is to prevent sending SMS in bulk again after DND is enabled for the contacts.   
  
**Q5.Is the auto append Sender ID and Opt-Out Language feature applying to every first text of workflow or manual SMS as well?**

`The "Opt out message" setting will apply SMS messages sent using these methods ``**if it is the first SMS message being sent to a new contact and that contact has never sent an SMS message to your system phone number:**`  
`1. A Bulk Action in the Contacts area of the app (i.e. when selecting multiple contacts and choosing the "Send SMS" button in the top toolbar`  
`2. Workflow "Send SMS" Actions `  
`3. Campaigns (legacy feature) `  
`4. One-on-One messages sent via the Conversations area of the app`
