## **What is SMS Restriction History?**

  


The **SMS Restriction History** dashboard provides businesses with a transparent way to track and manage their SMS sending activities. Logging warnings and restrictions helps users stay compliant with carrier guidelines and avoid disruptions in communication. A read‑only log showing warnings and temporary sending restrictions triggered by carrier‑ or policy‑driven thresholds. Typical causes include:

  


  * Daily/Weekly sending limit violations  
  

  * High opt‑out rate  
  

  * High delivery error rate (including carrier filtering such as Error 30007)


  


**Example:**

  
If a campaign generates a **6% opt‑out rate—above the 2–3% target** you should stay under—the sub‑account may receive a temporary restriction. The log captures the date, time, and additional details so you can investigate and avoid repeats.

## **Using the Restriction Log**

  


The table lists each restriction event with:

  


  * **Date** — when the warning or restriction occurred  
  


  * **Restriction Type** — Warning or Temporary Restriction  
  

  * **Restriction Reason** — e.g., Opt‑out rate exceeded threshold  
  

  * **Percentage / Count** — the measured value at the time (e.g., opt‑out %)  
  

  * **Additional Details** — related metrics such as Error Rate


* * *

## **Threshold guidance**

  


  * **Opt‑out rate:** Target: stay below 2–3% to avoid risk. Good: 0–1%. At 3%, the sub‑account is locked for 24 hours.  
  

  * **Delivery error rate:** Good: 0–6%. At 10%, the sub‑account is locked for 24 hours.


  

    
    
    **IMPORTANT** : After a lockout, review recent sends, content, list hygiene, and compliance settings before resuming.

## **What are the error and opt-out rates good for having a threshold?**

  


  1. A **High Opt-Out****rate** indicates that contacts receiving your messages have objected, generated complaints, or marked your SMS as spam. A good opt-out rate is typically in the range of 0—1%. Once the opt-out rate hits **3%** , the sub-account will be locked for sending text messages for 24 hours.  
  

  2. A **High Delivery Error Rate** indicates that you are sending SMS to contacts that are no longer in service, are unreachable, or use a non-SMS-capable device, such as a landline. This may also mean that external carrier filters are refusing to deliver your SMS due to bad sending behavior in the past. A good error rate is typically in the range of 0—6%. Once the error rate hits 10%, the sub-account will be locked for sending text messages for 24 hours.
