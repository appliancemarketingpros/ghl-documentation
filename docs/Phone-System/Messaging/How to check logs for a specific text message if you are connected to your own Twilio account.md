**Overview**  
  
Twilio provides tools to investigate messaging activity between Twilio and your application. If a message fails to go through, is delayed, or behaves unexpectedly, reviewing the **Messaging Logs** in Twilio should be your first step. These logs help you confirm delivery status, identify errors, and gather details for further troubleshooting.

Put the lead's phone number (remove all phone format) in the TO field:

### 5\. Review Log Entries

  * Each log line shows:

    * **Message SID** (unique identifier).

    * **TO and FROM numbers**.

    * **Status** (accepted, delivered, failed, etc.).

    * **Segments** (number of parts if the SMS was split).

    * **Media** (if MMS was attached).

  * Logs highlight issues:

    * **Yellow or red rows** indicate failed or problematic messages.

    * **Green (200 status)** indicates success.

If it says delivered but the contact is not receiving it, grab this Message SID and [Create a support ticket with Twilio support](<https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048500694-Contacting-Twilio-Support>)

### 6\. View Message Details

  * Click the **hyperlinked date** to see full details, including:

    * **Delivery Steps** : request creation, queue time, carrier handoff.

    * **Request Inspector** : requests/responses between Twilio and your app.

    * **Errors** : color-coded statuses (e.g., `404` if a webhook endpoint is missing).

  * Hovering over records will preview message content.  
  


In the detailed view of the message log, you can find the Message SID (Twilio's unique identifier for this message), as well as the time the resource was created, TO and FROM numbers, Delivery Steps, and the Request Inspector.

  


  


The Delivery Steps section of this log will show you when the request was created, how long it was queued on Twilio's platform, and when it was sent out to our carrier partner for delivery. These factors can help you determine where an undelivered message failed, or investigate latency issues.

The request inspector shows all requests and responses made when sending or receiving this message. You can easily see errors on requests by the color-coded status on the right of a request.

In the above response, we can see that we received a 404 response because Twilio was unable to find the tunnel for the webhook we set up for messages.
