## **What is the Error: Not a Valid SMS-Capable “From” Number**

  


This error appears when an outbound SMS/MMS is attempted from a number that isn’t eligible to send SMS for the selected destination, account, or configuration. The most common root causes are: the number isn’t SMS‑capable, it’s not on your account/location, it’s not linked to an approved A2P campaign (US 10DLC), or the From value is misconfigured (e.g., invalid format or incompatible sender type).

* * *

## **Quick Fix Checklist**

  


  * Verify the**From number** belongs to this sub‑account/location and is SMS‑capable.  
  

  * Use E.164 format in the From field (e.g., +15551234567).  
  

  * For **US 10DLC** , make sure the number is attached to an approved A2P campaign (Messaging Service → attached numbers).  
  

  * If using a Short Code, the To and From must be in the **same country**.  
  

  * If using an Alphanumeric Sender ID, confirm the destination country supports it.  
  

  * If you manage numbers in **Twilio Console** , ensure the number is capable and owned by your account (not another Master account).


  

    
    
    **Tip:** If this error started after a recent move or configuration change, re‑check number ownership (agency vs. sub‑account), campaign assignments, and any Messaging Service changes.

## **Common Causes & How to Resolve**

  


### **1\. Phone Number is not SMS‑capable**

  


Some phone numbers are voice‑only or don’t support SMS in certain countries.

  


  * **LC Phone:** Go to **Settings → Phone Numbers** , open the number, and confirm **Messaging** is enabled.  
  


  * **Twilio:** In Console, open the number and verify that **Capabilities** include **SMS**.  
  


  * **Fix:** Use an SMS‑capable number or purchase/assign one that supports messaging.

    **Tip** : For using the Phone Number Assignment Feature, refer to: [How to use this phone assignment feature for SMS/Voice capable only](<https://www.loom.com/share/075fefb6c4a345529aa761a3af973a1d?sid=651ce97b-2ecf-4e64-8818-bfa7312ee7cb>).

  


  


### **2\. The number isn’t valid for your account/destination**

  


The **From** must be a number **owned by (or hosted to)** your account and valid for the target country.

  


  * **Short Codes:** Must be in the **same country** as the destination.  
  


  * **Hosted/Trial/other account numbers:** Not valid until fully owned and SMS‑enabled on your account.  
  


  * **Fix:** Send from a number on your account that’s allowed for the destination.


  


  


### **3\. A2P 10DLC (US) configuration missing or wrong**

  


US local 10DLC numbers must be tied to an **approved A2P campaign**.

  


  * **LC Phone:** Confirm the number is linked to your approved **Brand/Campaign**.  
  


  * **Twilio:** Attach the number to the correct **Messaging Service** that’s tied to the approved campaign.  
  


  * **Fix:** Complete A2P registration and link the number; retry after approval.


  


  


### **4\. Formatting or sender type issues**

  


  * **E.164 required:** Use `+` and country code.  
  


  * **Alphanumeric Sender ID:** Only supported in specific countries (not US/CA person‑to‑person).  
  


  * **Fix:** Correct the **From** format or choose a supported sender type for the destination.


  


  


### **5\. Number recently moved or not in this Location**

  


If the number was **moved between sub‑accounts** or providers, the **From** selector or automations may still reference the old number.

  


**Fix:** Re‑select the active number in **Conversations** , **Campaigns/Workflows** , and **Messaging settings**.

* * *

## **Special Cases**

  


  * **Toll‑Free (US/CA):** Requires **Toll‑Free Verification** for reliable delivery. If unverified, messages may fail or be filtered.  
  


  * **International:** Some countries block A2P from long codes; use **Alphanumeric Sender ID** (if supported) or an approved sender per country rules.  
  


  * **Different Master Twilio account:** If your number lives under a different **Master** account, it isn’t valid for this account’s sends. Move it first or send from a number on this account.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q. Does this error mean the number is suspended?**  
Not necessarily. It usually means the number cannot send SMS for the current configuration. Check capability, ownership, and A2P linking.

  


  


**Q. Can I send from a short code to another country?**  
No. Short codes are **country‑specific** ; use a local short code for the destination country or another supported sender type.

  


  


**Q. We just ported/added a number and still see this error—why?**  
Provisioning or campaign linking can take time. Confirm SMS capability and, for the US, that the number is attached to your approved campaign.
