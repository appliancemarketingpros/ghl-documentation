# **Overview**

When sending SMS/MMS through Twilio (or integrated platforms), you may encounter cases where your message cannot be delivered because the recipient has **opted out** or enabled **Do Not Disturb (DND)**. This is enforced to honor user preferences and maintain compliance with messaging regulations.

* * *

## **Description**

The person you are trying to message has opted out of receiving messages from:

  * Your phone number,

  * Your Channels sender, or

  * Your Messaging Service.


Alternatively, the contact may have **DND (Do Not Disturb)** status enabled in their contact profile.

If a recipient has previously replied with **“STOP”** to one of your messages, you will not be able to send to them again until they respond with **“START.”**

* * *

## **Possible Causes**

  1. The recipient’s handset replied with **STOP** or another opt-out keyword.

  2. The phone number may have been **reassigned** to a new user who never opted in.

  3. The contact has enabled **DND** for SMS, calls, or all communication types.

  4. The platform blocks outgoing messages to respect regulatory and compliance requirements.


* * *

## **Possible Solutions**

  * **Remove unsubscribed numbers** from your contact list.

  * **Ask the recipient to re-subscribe** by texting **“START”** (or another opt-in keyword) to your number.

  * **Verify consent** before sending — ensure recipients have explicitly opted in to receive your messages.


* * *

## **Twilio-Specific Opt-Out Behavior**

If you attempt to send a message to a recipient who has opted out, the **Twilio API** will return an error, and the message will not be sent. You will not be charged for the attempt.

### Opt-Out Keywords (unsubscribe)

Messages will be blocked if the recipient replied with any of these:

  * STOP

  * STOPALL

  * UNSUBSCRIBE

  * CANCEL

  * END

  * QUIT


### Opt-In Keywords (resubscribe)

To resume receiving your messages, recipients must reply with:

  * START

  * YES


* * *

## **Important Notice**

  * If a user opts out of a **Messaging Service number** , the opt-out applies to **all messages** sent from that service.

  * This ensures subscribers are fully protected from unwanted communication.


* * *

**Key Takeaway:** Always secure **proper opt-in consent** , and respect opt-out requests. If someone has opted out, they must **manually opt back in** before you can send them messages again.
