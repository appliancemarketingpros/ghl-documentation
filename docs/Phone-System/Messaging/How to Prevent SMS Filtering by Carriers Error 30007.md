## What is Error 30007 – Carrier Filtering?

30007 is a **carrier-side error** that indicates your message was filtered due to **content, sender identity, or compliance reasons**.

This happens when a message:

  * Violates a carrier’s messaging policy.
  * Appears similar to spam or illegal traffic.
  * Is missing required compliance elements, like opt-in consent or sender identification.


These filters are enforced to protect consumers, comply with national regulations (like A2P 10DLC in the U.S.), and maintain platform trust.

Note

While this notification is in no way a change to the policies put forth by carriers, the CTIA, and Twilio, it is a reminder of what is and what is not acceptable within the North American messaging community.

We have been told by our carrier partners that there will be greater enforcement of messaging policies, and we expect to see increased filtering of the following:

  * Traffic, as identified by increasing customer complaints, that shows evidence of not gaining appropriate opt-in.
  * Informational and promotional traffic failing to have a clear description of how to opt-out, meaning STOP language is not clearly shown to the end user. _As a reminder, conversational traffic is consumer-initiated and does not require including STOP language in each response._

## How to Prevent Messages from Being Filtered

Below are structured guidelines based on carrier requirements, the platform’s policies, and industry best practices.

Step 1

Consent and Opt-In

  * Only message users who’ve **explicitly opted in**.
  * Your message must **identify the sender** and **include opt-out instructions**.
  * You must **include STOP language at least once every 30 days** if you message the same contact regularly.
  * Avoid creative variations like “**Reply 2 to unsubscribe** ” – these are **non-compliant** and will be filtered.
  * **Reconfirm opt-in every 18 months** to avoid accidental messaging of recycled numbers.
  * **Monitor opt-out rates and complaint spikes** – carriers will begin filtering traffic that shows abuse patterns.


Step 2

Use Case & Sender Selection

  * **Avoid forbidden use cases** , such as payday loans, debt relief, cannabis, etc. Check out our guide on [Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/48001219617>).
  * Do not “**snowshoe** ” across multiple numbers to evade filtering – use numbers based on geography or business units only.
  * Use pre-registered short codes or Alphanumeric Sender IDs where required, especially for countries like France.
  * Refer to **SMS Guidelines by Country** for local rules.


Step 3

Message Content & Formatting

  * Avoid public **URL shorteners** (like Bitly, TinyURL). **Use branded domains** like (yourbusiness.com/offer).
  * Never use **obfuscated links** or **suspicious redirects**.
  * Use **clear, well-written language** and avoid:
    * Emojis, excessive punctuation, or CAPS.
    * Misspellings or poor grammar.
  * Do not send **illegal** or **misleading content** , or anything listed in the Forbidden Categories link above.


Step 4

Opt-Out & Compliance Requirements

Your SMS must:

  * Contain **STOP** instructions (at least monthly).
  * Clearly **name the sender**.
  * Be sent only to users who gave explicit permission.


Step 5

Monitoring & DND Handling

  * Process **DND (Do Not Disturb) requests daily** – deactivated numbers are no longer valid recipients.
  * A message triggering 30007 can mark a contact as DND automatically.

## Best Practices

  * Use custom or branded short URLs linked to your business domain.
  * Limit redirects to no more than one, and avoid cloaking link destinations.
  * When possible, include the full URL to boost transparency (even if it takes extra characters).
  * Improving your URL practices can prevent filtering and ensure your messages reach their audience.
  * If sending links through SMS, only use links provided in their A2P.
  * Links will need to have that specific domain address when they send SMS, or else it could be filtered.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: Why does message filtering vary between carriers?

Each carrier uses different filtering logic and algorithms. A message blocked by one carrier (e.g., Verizon) might be delivered by another (e.g., AT&T), depending on the content, volume, and sender history.

Q: What if I’m messaging international numbers?

Each country has different SMS rules. Some require specific sender types (e.g., short codes or alpha IDs), and others restrict certain industries.

Q: How do I know if a contact was marked DND because of 30007?

You can check their conversation status, error logs, and delivery error codes. If they are in DND, and messages were previously filtered, it’s likely related.

Q: Will repeated 30007 errors block my number permanently?

It can lead to DND status, restriction, or even number deactivation if unresolved.

Q: How can I test if my messages will be filtered?

There’s no test tool, but following best practices significantly reduces the risk.

Q: Do I need A2P 10DLC if I only send to a small list?

Yes. Any U.S.-bound SMS traffic must comply with A2P 10DLC registration.

Q: Can I use emojis or shortened links?

Best to avoid both. Use only branded URLs and standard language formatting.
