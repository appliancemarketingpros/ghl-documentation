## **Rich Communication Services (RCS)** is a modern messaging standard that allows businesses to send richer, more interactive messages than traditional SMS.

With RCS, you can send:

  * Branded messages (business name displayed in supported inboxes)

  * Images and rich layouts

  * Tappable buttons (Call, Open URL, Suggested replies)

  * Interactive cards and carousels (if enabled)


When a recipient cannot receive RCS, HighLevel automatically falls back to SMS (if enabled).  
  


  


  


* * *

## **Why Use RCS Instead of SMS?**

  


RCS helps you:

  * Present a more branded experience

  * Increase engagement with tappable actions

  * Share richer content (images, structured cards)

  * Improve clarity with interactive message flows

  * Track delivery and read signals (when supported)


  


### RCS vs SMS/MMS

Feature| RCS| SMS| MMS  
---|---|---|---  
Reach| Compatible devices only| Nearly universal| Nearly universal  
Branding| Business identity visible| Phone number| Phone number  
Media| Native rich media & cards| Text only| Media (less consistent)  
Buttons| Yes| No| No  
Read receipts| Often available| No| No  
Fallback| Falls back to SMS| N/A| N/A  
  
  


**Best Practice:** Always design messages so they still work as SMS.

## What you can do with RCS in HighLevel

Depending on your plan and launch scope, you can typically:

  * Send 1:1 RCS messages from Conversations

  * Send RCS campaigns using Bulk Actions

  * Use media (images) and actions/buttons (where enabled)

  * Track delivery signals (and “read” where available)

  * Use SMS fallback when a recipient can’t receive RCS


* * *

# **RCS Availability & Requirements (US Launch)**

### Who Can Receive RCS?

RCS can be delivered to recipients who:

  * Have an RCS-supported device

  * Use an RCS-capable messaging app

  * Have RCS enabled

  * Are on a supported carrier/network


Some recipients will receive RCS, others will receive SMS fallback.

###   
**1\. Device & App Support**

RCS is commonly supported on:

  * Many Android devices using an RCS-capable messaging app (often Google Messages or carrier-supported apps)

  * Recipient-side settings must allow RCS features (users can disable RCS)


### **2** _**.**_**IPhone Support**

RCS support on iPhone depends on OS/app ecosystem and carrier enablement. For many audiences, iPhone recipients may receive SMS fallback instead of RCS.

  


Note- 1. Always design your messaging so it still works when delivered as SMS.

  


## 3\. Carrier/network factors (why results vary)

Even within the U.S.,

  * Results may vary based on carrier and network conditions.

  * Some carriers or device configurations may limit RCS support, affecting available features.

  * Temporary network issues can trigger fallback from RCS to SMS/MMS.

  * App-level settings, such as “Chat features” or read receipts, can also change the messaging experience.


  


### **4\. Media & Feature Variability**

RCS features can vary across recipient apps. When building rich messages:

1\. Keep copy clear even without rich components

2\. Avoid relying on a single button or image for critical info

3\. Always include a plain-text fallback message

  


  


* * *

# **RCS Compliance & Consent (US)**

## **1\. Opt-In Requirements**

You should send RCS only to recipients who have explicitly opted in.

Your opt-in must clearly state:

  * Message type (promotions, reminders, updates, etc.)

  * Expected frequency (“up to X per week/month”)

  * How to opt out

  * How to get support  
  


## **2. Opt-Out Handling**

Recipients must be able to opt out easily.

  * Treat common keywords like STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, QUIT as opt-out signals.

  * Once a contact opts out, they should not receive further messages unless they opt back in.


## **3.****Content guidelines (restricted/prohibited content)**

To protect deliverability and compliance, avoid sending:

  * Deceptive or misleading content

  * Spammy/repetitive content without consent

  * Content that violates Twilio policies or applicable laws/regulations


For regulated industries, ensure your content aligns with your legal obligations.

## **4\. Brand identification & user trust**

RCS is a more branded channel; keep your sender identity consistent:

  * Use a sender name that matches your business or website

  * Ensure your website and sender profile describe the same business

  * Provide valid contact/support information


## 5\. Quiet hours and frequency best practices

  * Send during reasonable local hours to respect recipients’ time and avoid disruptions.

  * Keep frequency aligned with what was promised at opt-in to maintain trust and prevent message fatigue.

  * Provide value first reminders, confirmations, and helpful updates typically perform best and drive stronger engagement.

For guidance, refer to this article: [How to Onboard an RCS Sender ID in HighLevel (Non-ISV)](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000007603-how-to-create-rcs-sender-id-on-twilio>)


Sender details typically include your brand information and business identity listed above.

##   


## **Step 3: Submit for Approval**

HighLevel Support will submit your RCS sender profile for approval on your behalf.

Approval is required before you can begin sending RCS messages.

##

To ensure message delivery when RCS is unavailable:

  1. Go to **Settings → Messaging → RCS → Fallback**

  2. Enable:  
**Fallback to SMS**


This ensures:

  * RCS messages are sent to compatible recipients

  * SMS is automatically used when RCS is not available


##   


## **S****tep 5: Send a Test Message**

  1. Go to **Conversations**

  2. Select a test contact (a US Android device is recommended)

  3. Send a text-only message first

  4. Then test rich content (if enabled)


Note: Some recipients may receive an SMS fallback instead of RCS , this is expected behavior.

Note- Bulk Actions is currently the only method for sending RCS snippets.

# **3\. Creating RCS Snippets**

RCS Snippets are pre-designed RCS message templates that allow you to send structured, rich messages instead of typing messages manually each time.

They are reusable message formats created inside the platform and can include interactive and visual elements supported by RCS.

RCS snippets can be created under:

Conversations → Snippets

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155065185258/original/Ib_Tag3fFFmAHTxrp2FcZ4o4rjlEwSPenw.png?1771423242)

 _**Available formats:**_

  * Plain Text  
  


  * Standalone Card  
  


  * Carousel  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155065185257/original/f3sLybEK8haUpkRWoOvwQiiP2-JLQ7fitQ.png?1771423241)


  
Explanation-  


  


**1.** **Plain Texts** is used to send a simple text message. You enter the message content, and a live preview shows how it will appear on the recipient’s device. This format does not include media or buttons.

###   


**2.** **Standalone card** allows you to create one rich card with a title, description, and uploaded media. You can add up to three action buttons. A fallback SMS message is required in case the contact is not RCS-capable.

###   


**3\. Carousel** allows you to create multiple rich cards in a swipeable format. Each card includes a title, description, media, and up to two action buttons. A fallback SMS message is required for non-RCS-capable contacts

# **RCS Message Statuses**

RCS messages display status indicators reflecting message progress, such as:

  * Sent

  * Delivered

  * Opened


These statuses are visible within the conversation interface.

* * *

# **Fallback to SMS: How It Works**

Fallback occurs when:

  * Recipient cannot receive RCS

  * Network limitations exist

  * Rich components aren't supported


If fallback occurs:

  * The recipient receives SMS

  * Billing may reflect SMS pricing


Opt-outs apply across both RCS and SMS.

* * *

# **Opt-Out Behavior**

  * Opt-out text is appended to the first 1:1 RCS message

  * It does not repeat periodically like SMS

  * Texas blocking rules apply the same as SMS/MMS

  * STOP and equivalent keywords suppress across channels![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155065185263/original/urDzOmQftpqOoqxe1tcOJYmOLU0fF6eM3Q.png?1771423242)
