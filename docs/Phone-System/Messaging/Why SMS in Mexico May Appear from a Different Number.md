## **Overview**

When sending SMS in Mexico, recipients may sometimes see a **different number** than the one listed in your **Phone Numbers tab**. This is not a system error but rather a result of **local carrier regulations and anti-spam policies**. Understanding these rules is essential to avoid confusion and ensure compliance.

## **Key Points**

###  1\. Sender ID Behavior in Mexico

  * Mobile carriers in Mexico have **strict regulations** on SMS sender IDs.

  * Messages sent from **long codes** (regular phone numbers) may have their sender ID overwritten or replaced with a random or generic number, particularly for **application-to-person (A2P)** traffic.

  * **AT &T Mexico** is somewhat unique—it sometimes allows person-to-person (P2P) SMS from regular numbers, but this is not guaranteed across all scenarios or volumes.


###   


### 2\. Message Volume and Sender ID Changes

  * There is no official regulation stating “nine texts in two minutes,” but this reflects **carrier anti-spam logic**.

  * If a phone number sends **high volumes of SMS in a short time** , carriers may:

    * Reclassify the traffic as A2P.

    * Automatically **rewrite the sender ID**.

    * In some cases, **block the messages** altogether.

  * These measures are in place to comply with **local spam and regulatory requirements**.


###   


### 3\. Why Recipients See a Different Number

  * If you send SMS from a **regular number** and exceed allowed patterns or volume, the **carrier may override your sender ID**.

  * This results in recipients seeing a **different number** or a **generic sender ID** , even though you sent it from your configured number.


###   


### 4\. Default Sender ID Registration

  * If you have a **registered Sender ID in Mexico** , Twilio will use it consistently.

  * If you do not, the **default carrier behavior** applies, which may include sender ID changes.


* * *

## **Suggested Solution**

To ensure consistent SMS delivery in Mexico:

  * **Register a Sender ID** approved for Mexico.

  * Or, use a **short code** or another compliant messaging channel designed for **A2P traffic**.


These options guarantee that messages display a **consistent sender ID** and comply fully with **local carrier rules**.

## **Final Note**

If your recipients in Mexico are seeing a different number than expected, it is due to **carrier enforcement** —not a misconfiguration in your account or Twilio. This behavior is beyond your direct control unless you register an official Sender ID or adopt a supported A2P channel.
