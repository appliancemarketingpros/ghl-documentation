## **What is Local Presence Dialing?**

  


Local Presence Dialing dynamically selects the most appropriate outbound phone number/caller ID number based on a contact’s phone number area code. By leveraging region-specific numbers you’ve purchased and verified, calls appear local to recipients, significantly improving pick-up rates and fostering trust.

  


  


### **Key Points to Remember**

  


  * Supports all area codes of a region: If calling a contact with area code 241 in Dallas,
    * If you have a phone number with the area code 241, that phone number will be used to make the call
    * If you do not have a phone number with area code 241. But you do have a Dallas number with area code 972, the 972 number will be used to make the call
    * If you do not have a phone number belonging to any area code of Dallas, the sub-account's default phone number will be used to make the call  
  

  * Sub-account's default phone number is used as the backup in case no phone numbers match the region.  
  

  * Supports USA/Canada only.

## **Key Benefits of Local Presence Dialing**

  


Local Presence Dialing offers several advantages that help improve engagement and build stronger trust with your contacts.

  


  * **Higher Answer Rates** : Local caller IDs feel familiar, encouraging recipients to answer unknown numbers.  
  


  * **Improved Brand Trust** : Consistent local presence builds credibility and reduces spam perception.  
  


  * **Automated Number Selection** : Eliminates manual switching—calls automatically use the matching or regional number.  
  


  * **Regional Fallback Support** : If an exact area code match isn’t available, another number from the same region will be used.  
  


  * **Flexibility** : Can be enabled or disabled at the sub-account level, giving businesses control over who uses it.

## **How Local Presence Dialing Works**

  


Understanding how the feature selects caller IDs ensures you maximize its benefits in outbound calling.

  


  * When initiating an outbound call, the system checks the contact’s phone number area code against your pool of available numbers.  
  

  * If an exact match exists, the call uses that number as the caller ID.  
  

  * If no exact match exists, the system will attempt to use a number from the same geographic region (e.g., a different Dallas area code).  
  

  * If no regional match is available, the sub-account’s default caller ID will be used.  
  

  * Number selection logic runs in real time without any user intervention.
