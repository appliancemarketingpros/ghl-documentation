## **Moving phone numbers**

  


This guide covers all number-move possibilities in HighLevel—LC→Twilio, Twilio→LC, LC→LC (same agency), LC→LC (different agencies), and porting a non-Twilio carrier number into LC—and explains the essentials in one place: you’ll gather the right identifiers (US: Twilio Account SID, gaining for LC→Twilio, losing for Twilio→LC—plus the destination sub-account ID; International: Regulatory Bundle SID and Address SID), and open a HighLevel Support ticket; we manage coordination end-to-end, there may be a brief cutover interruption. 

  


Collect the required IDs and number(s), then open a HighLevel Support ticket with those details and your preferred cutover window. We coordinate the migration and confirm when traffic is live. After completion, place quick inbound/outbound call and SMS tests. We cover five cases:

  


  1. LC (LeadConnector) → Twilio  
  

  2. Twilio → LC (LeadConnector)  
  

  3. LC → LC (both sub‑accounts in the different agencies)  
  

  4. LC → LC (sub‑accounts in same agency)  
  

  5. Porting a non‑Twilio phone number into HighLevel


  


  

    
    
    **Before you start:**  
      
    **US numbers:** Have the relevant Twilio Account SID (gaining for LC→Twilio, losing for Twilio→LC), the destination sub-account ID, and the phone number(s).  
      
    **International numbers:** Have the Regulatory Bundle SID, Address SID, and the phone number(s) (include country).

* * *

## **Case 1: LC → Twilio**

  


Use this when you’re moving a number from LeadConnector (LC) to your own Twilio. **For US numbers** , include the gaining Twilio Account SID, the destination subaccount (if used), and the phone number(s). 

  


For **International numbers** , provide the Regulatory Bundle SID and Address SID instead of the Account SID, plus the phone number(s). Open a HighLevel Support ticket with these details and your preferred cutover window; we’ll coordinate the migration and confirm once traffic is live on Twilio.

## **Case 2: Twilio → LC (LeadConnector)**

  


Use this when you’re moving a number from your Twilio into LeadConnector (LC). For **US numbers** , include the losing Twilio Account SID, the destination HighLevel sub-account ID, and the phone number(s). 

  


For **International numbers** , include the Regulatory Bundle SID and Address SID instead of the Account SID, plus the phone number(s). Open a HighLevel Support ticket with those details and your preferred cutover window; we’ll handle the move and let you know when it’s ready to test.

## **Case 3: LC → LC****(sub-accounts in different agencies)**

  


Use this when you’re moving a number between two different HighLevel agencies. Provide the relevant Twilio Account SID for US moves (or Regulatory Bundle SID + Address SID for International), the destination agency and sub-account ID, and the phone number(s). Open a HighLevel Support ticket with these details and your preferred cutover window; we’ll coordinate the inter-agency move and confirm when the number is live in the destination account.

    **IMPORTANT****:** Presently, Case 1 (LC→Twilio), Case 2 (Twilio→LC), and Case 3 (LC→LC — agency is different) **follow the same process.** Customers only need to provide the appropriate Twilio Account SID—the gaining SID when moving into Twilio or the losing SID when moving out of Twilio—plus the destination sub-account ID and the phone number(s). HighLevel Support will coordinate the migration end-to-end. For international numbers, provide the Regulatory Bundle SID and Address SID instead of the Account SID.

## **Case 4: LC → LC (sub-accounts in same agency)**

  


Use this when you’re transferring a number between two LC sub-accounts inside one HighLevel agency. Inside HighLevel, the Move Numbers tool (Settings → Phone Integration) lets you pick the source number(s), choose the destination sub-account, and complete the transfer. It supports LC Phone↔LC Phone and transfers involving Twilio-connected sub-accounts under the same Twilio master, with notes on common blockers like mismatched Twilio masters or missing regulatory bundles/addresses; if the built-in tool fails for LC Phone→LC Phone, contact HighLevel Support with the source and destination location IDs so we can assist.

## **Case 5: Port a non-Twilio phone number into HighLevel (LC)**

  


Use this when your number is with a non-Twilio carrier and you want it managed in LeadConnector (LC). Gather the number(s) and any carrier paperwork requested in the linked guide, then open a HighLevel Support ticket with your desired cutover window. We’ll manage the porting process and notify you when it’s ready to test.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q. Will my contacts, conversations, or analytics move with the number?**  
No. The migration changes the number ownership/routing only. Export/download data you need to keep before cutover.

  


  


**Q. Do past call recordings and voicemails migrate?**  
No. Future recordings/voicemails follow the number after cutover. Download any historical assets you need to retain.

  


  


**Q. Do A2P/Toll-Free approvals transfer automatically?**  
Not always. After the move, confirm your numbers are attached to the correct **brand/campaign** or **Toll-Free verification**.

  


  


**Q. Can I move multiple numbers at once?**  
Yes. Include a single list (CSV or inline) in your ticket and validate each number after cutover.

  


  


**Q. What if I need to roll back?**  
Reply to the ticket immediately during the window; rollback options depend on the carrier and timing.
