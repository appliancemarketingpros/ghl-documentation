## **What is Move Numbers?**

  


Move Numbers is an in‑app workflow in Settings → Phone Integration that reassigns existing phone numbers from a **source** sub‑account to a **destination** sub‑account **within the same Agency**. Eligibility at a glance:

  


  * **LC Phone ↔ LC Phone (same Agency):** Supported in-app.  
  


  * **Twilio ↔ Twilio (same Master Twilio account):** Supported in-app.  
  


  * **Different Master Twilio accounts:** Not supported in-app—contact **Twilio Support**.  
  


  * **Geography:** The in-app tool currently supports **US & Canada** numbers. For other countries, please open a **HighLevel Support** ticket.  
  


  * **A2P:** A2P status is at the sub‑account level and **does not move** with the phone number; reattach the correct brand/campaign after moving.


* * *

## **Before You Begin**

  


  * Make sure you have admin access to the **source** and **destination** sub‑accounts.  
  


  * Identify the **destination Location ID** (a.k.a. Sub‑account ID): **Settings → Business Profile**.  
  


  * Confirm which phone system the number uses today:

    * **LC Phone** (LeadConnector)  
  


    * **Twilio** connected at the Agency level

    **Please Note:** Review the summary and click Move Numbers to start the transfer. Numbers will appear in the destination sub‑account once complete. After the move, re‑check number‑level settings (forwarding, recordings, whispers, etc.). Verify call/SMS flows, automations, and user assignments as needed.

## **Troubleshooting & Known Limitations**

  


If the **Move Numbers** action is unavailable or fails, common causes include:

  


  1. **Different Twilio master accounts:** Numbers under a different Twilio master can’t be moved in‑app. Contact Twilio Support in this case.  
  

  2. **Missing regulatory configuration (international):** Some countries (e.g., AU +61) require approved **Regulatory Bundles** and an **Address SID** in the **destination**. Configure those first, then follow the relevant migration guide.  
  


  3. **Provider mismatch:** If you’re converting **Twilio ↔ LC Phone** , follow the dedicated [conversion articles](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006369-moving-phone-numbers-migration-guide>) rather than the in‑app move.  
  


  4. **Country support (US & Canada in-app): **The in-app tool currently moves **US & Canada** numbers. For other countries, please create a **HighLevel Support** ticket.
