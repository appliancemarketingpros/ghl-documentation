## **What is Timezone Adaptation?**

Timezone Adaptation allows your countdown timer’s **end time** to automatically adjust based on the viewer’s timezone. Whether your user is in India, the US, or Australia, they will see the timer end at the correct local moment.

**Example:**  
If you set a Christmas countdown to end on _25th December_ , a user in India will see it end at **25th December IST** , while a user in New York sees it end at **25th December EST** — without any extra setup.

This ensures:

  * Accurate timing for promotions

  * Higher trust and clarity in deadline-based campaigns

  * Global consistency for distributed audiences


* * *

## **How Timezone Logic Works**

The system follows a clear hierarchy depending on whether the timer is used in **emails** or **funnels/websites**.

* * *

## **Timezone Adaptation Order**

### **1\. Emails**

Emails rely on **contact-level data**.

Scenario| What Happens  
---|---  
**Contact's timezone is set**|  End time converts to the contact’s timezone.  
**Contact's timezone is NOT set**|  We retain the original timezone selected when creating the timer (fallback).  
  
This ensures the most accurate and personalized countdown for each contact.

* * *

### **2\. Funnels & Websites**

For web experiences, real-time visitor context is used.

Scenario| What Happens  
---|---  
Viewer lands on a page| Timer adapts using the **IP-detected timezone**.  
  
If IP detection fails, the timer uses the creator’s selected timezone.  
  
  


> **NOTE** : For dynamic timers used in funnels, if funnel is redirected via email then email logic is used for timezone adaption.

## **How Will This Work?**

When creating a countdown timer:

  1. User selects an **End Date & Time**

  2. Below the timezone dropdown, a new setting appears:  
**☑ Adapt to Contact Time Zone**

  3. If checked:

     * The system automatically applies the appropriate timezone logic

  4. For contacts without a timezone, fallback = selected timezone in the dropdown

  5. For websites/funnels, IP-based timezone detection applies automatically

> **NOTE** : For recurring countdown timers, the **start time adapts to each viewer’s local timezone** , and the **end time is automatically calculated** based on the timer’s recurrence conditions — ensuring accurate, localized cycles for every user.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q:**What happens if a contact has no timezone?****

The timer uses the timezone chosen in the creation settings (fallback).  
  


**Q: How do recurring timers work with timezone adaptation?**

The start time adapts to each viewer’s timezone, and the end time is auto-calculated based on the recurring rules.

  


**Q: Does enabling adaptation remove timezone selection?  
** No, the selection is still visible, preserving clarity for fallback logic.
