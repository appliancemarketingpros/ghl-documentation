## **What is the New Affiliate Sales Trigger?**

  
The New Affiliate Sale trigger fires every time an affiliate successfully makes a sale—whether it's a one-time, recurring, or manually tracked transaction.

  
You can use it to:  
  


  * Congratulate affiliates  
  

  * Notify customers  
  

  * Assign tasks  
  

  * Segment contacts  
  

  * And more—automatically  
  


  

    
    
    **Important: Who the workflow runs on (Buyer vs Affiliate)**
    
    Automations in Workflows always run “on” a primary record. With the New Affiliate Sale trigger, the workflow commonly starts from the customer/buyer side of the transaction, which means standard actions like Send Email/SMS will message the buyer contact unless you intentionally choose an affiliate-specific action.
    
    To communicate with the affiliate (congratulations, reminders, status updates), use workflow actions designed for affiliates (example: Send email to affiliate).

## **Popular Use Cases**

  


Here are a few examples of how to put the Affiliate Sales Trigger to use:  
  


### 1\. **Congratulate the Affiliate**  
  


  * **Why:** Keeps affiliates motivated and increases repeat promotion.  
  

  * **How:** After the trigger fires, add an affiliate communication action (example: **Internal Notification**) so the message goes to the **affiliate** rather than the **buyer contact**.  
  
**Note:** This action sends an internal notification (to the business/admin) about the affiliate sale. It does not send an email to the affiliate.  
  

  * **Example message:** “Congrats on your new sale! ? Keep it going—your commissions are growing.”  
  


### 
    
    
    Add an Internal Notification action to alert your team whenever a new affiliate sale occurs.
    
    The “Send Email to Affiliate” action is intended for internal alerts, not communication with the affiliate.

  


### 2\. **Remind Affiliates to Complete Payout Info**  
  


  * **Why** : Reduce payout delays  
  

  * **Example** : Send a reminder: "Update your payout method to receive your commission."


###   
3\. **Tag Customers from Affiliate Sales**  
  


  * **Why** : Segment affiliate-driven leads for future campaigns  
  

  * **Example** : Add tag: "Affiliate Customer"  
  


    
    
    **Known Limitation**
    
    Some users expect the New Affiliate Sale trigger to automatically “switch” the workflow to the affiliate’s community user profile. Workflows don’t automatically swap the primary record mid-flow—so rewarding affiliate community points may require routing the automation so it runs on the affiliate’s record when granting points.
    
    **Workaround Options**
    
    If you primarily need to communicate with affiliates, use affiliate communication actions (example: Send email to affiliate) immediately after the trigger.
    
    If you need to grant community points reliably, use a workflow design that awards points only when the target user is the group member, and then apply Grant community group leaderboard points.

  
By implementing these automations, businesses can create a seamless experience for both affiliates and customers, enhancing satisfaction, engagement, and performance.
