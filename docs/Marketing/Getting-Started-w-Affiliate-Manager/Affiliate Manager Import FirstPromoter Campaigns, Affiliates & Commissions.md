This ensures clean data, preserved history, and a faster transition compared to manual exports.

  


  * Connect your FirstPromoter account with **Account ID** and **API Key**

  * Select campaigns and import preferences

  * Review/resolve email conflicts, then import

### **Set Preferences**

  


Turn on **Pending Commissions** if needed and confirm **Payout Terms**. Fine-tune what gets imported and how payouts will be scheduled so your finance workflow remains consistent after migration.

  


  * **Pending Commissions** (toggle): Include unpaid commissions from FirstPromoter if you want them tracked immediately in HighLevel.


  


  * **Current Payout Terms** (dropdown, e.g., **Net-30 (30 days after month ends)**): Determines when imported commissions become due inside Affiliate Manager.

### **Review Affiliates**

  


On **Affiliate Management** , resolve any **Conflicts** by choosing **Merge** or **Skip**. New affiliates are created as contacts automatically. If an email already exists, you’ll resolve the conflict to maintain a single, clean CRM profile.

  


  * Tabs show **Total** , **New** , and **Conflicts**.


  


  * For conflicts, compare **Affiliate Name** , **Status** , **Email** , and **Join Date**.


  


  * Actions typically include **Merge** (retain the existing contact and attach affiliate data) or **Skip** (do not import this affiliate now).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I still need CSV exports from FirstPromoter?**

No. The API-based wizard replaces manual CSV transfers for supported data.

  


**Q: What happens to commission statuses during import?**

Each commission keeps its original status (e.g., Pending/Approved). Payout timing follows the **Payout Terms** you set in Preferences.

  


**Q: Can I include unpaid earnings?**

Yes. Toggle **Pending Commissions** to bring over unpaid items so they appear in Affiliate Manager’s payout workflow.

  


**Q: Will the importer create duplicate contacts?**

No. Duplicate emails are flagged for review. Use **Merge** to keep a single contact record with affiliate data attached or **Skip** to exclude that entry.

  


**Q: Can I run the import more than once?**

Yes. You can re-run the wizard to import additional campaigns or affiliates; previously imported items are not duplicated.

  


**Q: Are product-based commissions supported?**

Not during the import itself. After the import, configure product-based commission rules directly in **Affiliate Manager**.

  


**Q: Where do I add the tracking scripts after import?**

Open the imported campaign, use the campaign list **⋯** menu to locate tracking scripts, and add them before activating the campaign.
