# Supported User Properties

  1. We support various user properties that can be passed in the URL. Replace the **property** in {{user.**userpropertyhere**}} with any of the following supported user properties:
     * companyId
     * email
     * phone
     * role
     * type
     * firstName
     * lastName
     * name
     * fullName
  2. For example, you can use https://yourwebsiteurlhere.com/?user={{user.firstName}} to pass the user's first name in the URL.
