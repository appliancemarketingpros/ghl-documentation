# **What is a Custom Object?**

  


Custom Objects let you define brand-new record types—each with its own fields, associations, and automations—so your CRM mirrors your real-world processes. They’re ideal when standard objects aren’t enough (e.g., tracking a “Property” with MLS, Bedrooms, Status; or a “Pet” with Breed, Vaccinations). After you create an object, you can use it across views, filters, and automations.

## **Key Benefits of Custom Objects**

  


Understanding the practical upside helps you design data models that stay flexible and future-proof.

  


  * **Flexibility** : define any entity with custom fields, labels, and associations.  
  


  * **Automation** : trigger workflows on create/update and run object-specific actions.  
  


  * **Insights** : analyze object data via SmartLists and List View, then filter precisely with Advanced Filters.  
  


  * **Governance** : maintain integrity with clear ownership—admins manage object definitions.  
  


  * **Plan access & limits**: available on all plans; up to 10 Custom Objects per location.


* * *

## **Field Types & Unique Fields **

  


Choosing the right field types and uniqueness rules keeps your data clean and merge-friendly.  
  


  * Supported **unique field types** today: Single Line Text, Multi Line Text, Number, Phone.  
  


  * **Limit:** up to **10 unique fields per object**.  
  


  * **Scope:** uniqueness is enforced across the sub-account and across all entry points (UI, Workflows, Forms, API).  
  


  * **Irreversible change:** if you **downgrade** a unique field to non-unique, you **cannot** make it unique again.


* * *

## **Associations & Labels**

  


Associations connect records (e.g., Opportunity ↔ Property) to reflect real-world relationships and power cross-object views.  
  


  * Define many-to-many or one-to-many links between objects.  
  


  * Use associations in SmartLists, filters, and automations.  
  


  * **Label limits:** up to **10 unique labels** between any two objects (for clarity like “Buyer Of,” “Listed On”).  
  


  * Opportunities now support flexible associations to Custom Objects for a unified pipeline context.

## **How To Set Up Custom Objects**

  


A clean initial setup ensures stable automation and reporting as your model grows. The steps below are sourced from **Creating and Editing Custom Objects** and lightly clarified for readability.

  


### **Step 1 — Create the Object**

  


  1. Go to **Sub-account → Settings → Objects**.  
  


  2. Click **Add Custom Object**.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058405899/original/19muD-f-IgODYh2yNQ--bLnKCPn89sP4Yg.png?1763126731)  
  


### **Step 2 — Add Details about the Object**

###   


  1. Enter the **Singular name** (e.g., Pet).

  2. Enter the **Plural name** (e.g., Pets).

  3. Review the **Internal Name** and **Primary field** (created by default). You can adjust the internal name **during creation** by clicking **< />**.

  4. Provide a label for the **Primary display field** (e.g., Pet Name, Pet Identification Number).

  5. Choose an **Icon** and add a **Description** to help your team understand the object’s purpose.

  6. Click **Create Custom Object**.

### **Step 3 — Edit Object Details**

  


  1. After creation, the object appears on the Objects page.

  2. Click the object to open and adjust its details.

###   
**Optional — Delete a Custom Object (Irreversible)**

  


  1. Click the **⋯ (three dots)** next to the object’s name.

  2. Choose **Delete**.

  3. Type **DELETE** to confirm.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155058406564/original/DIem8kq3voYpJAFkfcf-oqn43QIQXi24Cg.gif?1763127036)  


    
    
    Imp: Deletion removes the object and **all records, associations, workflows, and custom fields** linked to it; this cannot be recovered.

* * *

## **Using Custom Objects in Workflows (Automation)**

  


Once you’ve created a Custom Object (and its fields/associations), you can automate processes around that object using **object-based workflows -** meaning the workflow “runs on” the Custom Object record itself (not just the Contact). This lets you trigger automation when a Custom Object record is created/updated and then take actions like creating/updating related records, clearing fields, or sending object data out to other tools.

  


### **Available triggers for Custom Object workflows**

  


In object-based workflows, you can start automation using these trigger types:

  


Trigger name| What it does  
---|---  
**[Custom Object] Created** (e.g., _Home Created_)| Starts the workflow when a Custom Object record is created.  
**[Custom Object] Changed** (e.g., _Home Changed_)| Starts the workflow when a Custom Object record is updated/changed.  
**Inbound Webhook**|  Starts the workflow when an inbound webhook is received (useful for external system updates).  
  
###   


### **Available actions for Custom Object workflows**

  


After a trigger fires, you can automate next steps using actions like:

  


Action name| What it does  
---|---  
**Create [Custom Object] or Associated Record**|  Creates a new Custom Object record (or a record that’s associated to it).  
**Update [Custom Object] or Associated Record**|  Updates fields on the Custom Object record (or an associated record).  
**Clear fields of [Custom Object] or Associated Record**|  Clears selected fields on the Custom Object record (or an associated record).  
**Custom Webhook**|  Sends Custom Object data to an external endpoint.  
**Google Sheets**|  Sends/logs Custom Object data to a Google Sheet.  
  
  


You can also combine Custom Object automation with common workflow utilities like If/Else, Wait, Go To, Formatters, Update Custom Value, Add/Remove from Workflow, and more to build more advanced logic.

  


### **How to create a Custom Object workflow**

  


  1. Go to **Automation** and click on **\+ Create Workflow** **→ [Custom Object] based workflow** you want to build the workflow around (for example: _Home, Vehicle, Policy, Pet_ , etc.).

  2. Add a trigger, then configure conditions/filters as needed.

  3. Add the workflow actions you want to run, then Publish.
