## **What is the New SaaS Plan Created Webhook?**

  


New SaaS Plan Created is an automated event trigger that fires as soon as a new SaaS plan is added to your HighLevel account. It returns a payload identical to the GET /plans endpoint, delivering detailed information including plan configuration, metadata, bundled features from the saasProducts array, pricing options from the prices array, and any optional add-ons from the addOns array. This feature is ideal for ensuring your billing systems, analytics tools, and third-party integrations remain up to date. For further technical details, please refer to the [Developer Resources](<https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/webhook/SaaSPlanCreate/index.html>).

  


  


Whenever a new SaaS plan is added via the platform, this webhook triggers automatically. It returns the same structure as the GET /plans endpoint, giving you full visibility into:

  


  * Plan configuration and metadata  
  

  * Included features via the saasProducts array  
  

  * Pricing details (e.g., monthly, yearly options) via the prices array  
  

  * Optional add-ons are included in the add-ons array

## **Security Requirements**

  


Protect your endpoint by validating each webhook request.

HighLevel signs webhook payloads with an HMAC SHA256 signature included in the X-HighLevel-Signature header. By verifying this signature against your secret key, you can confirm the authenticity of each notification and safeguard against tampering.

## **Error Handling & Versioning**

  


Ensure robust processing by accounting for failures and future changes.

  


  * **Error Codes:** Respond with HTTP 2xx for success. For non-2xx responses, HighLevel retries up to three times with exponential backoff.  
  


  * **Rate Limits:** Webhook events are rate-limited to 100 requests per minute per company.  
  


  * **Versioning:** The payload follows version v1. Future versions will increment the endpoint path (e.g., /v2/agency-plans). Always check the schemaVersion field to adapt to new formats.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: How do I retrieve past plan creation events?**

Use the GET /plans endpoint to list historical plans; webhooks only deliver new events.

  


  


**Q: What happens if my endpoint returns HTTP 500?**

HighLevel retries delivery up to three times with exponential backoff. Ensure your endpoint handles idempotency.

  


  


**Q: Can I filter specific plan types from the webhook?**

No, this webhook fires for all plan creations. Implement filtering logic in your receiver based on metadata or plan properties.

  


  


**Q: Will I receive updates if a plan is modified?**

No. For plan updates, subscribe to the separate **Webhook: SaaS Plan Updated** event.

  


  


**Q: How should I handle schema changes?**

Check the schemaVersion field in each payload and adjust parsing logic for new versions.

  


  


**Q: How do I verify that the webhook is working correctly?**

After setup, create a new SaaS plan to confirm that the webhook triggers and returns the expected data payload.
