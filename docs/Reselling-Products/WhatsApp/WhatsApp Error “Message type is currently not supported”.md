## Why This Happens

This error usually occurs in the following situations:

1| Unsupported Media Type

  * Trying to send file formats not allowed by WhatsApp (for example, .exe, .zip, .tar).
  * WhatsApp supports only specific media formats like images (JPG, PNG), documents (PDF, DOCX), videos (MP4), and audio (AAC, MP3, OGG).

  
---|---  
2| Unsupported Message Type

  * Certain interactive features (like custom unsupported buttons or message structures) are not available.
  * Document messages with captions are currently not supported.
  * Attempting to send stickers, GIFs, or other unsupported formats.

  
---|---  
3| Template Restrictions

  * If you are using a WhatsApp Template, the template body or header might include a type of parameter that is not supported.

## How to Fix It

Check Media File Format

Use only WhatsApp-supported file types:

  * **Images:** JPG, JPEG, PNG (max 5 MB)
  * **Documents:** PDF, DOCX, PPTX, XLSX, TXT
  * **Audio:** AAC, MP3, OGG
  * **Video:** MP4 (max 16 MB)


Check Message Content

  * Avoid sending stickers, GIFs, or files not supported by WhatsApp.
  * Use approved templates for proactive messaging.


Reconfigure Templates (if used)

  * Ensure the message template is approved and follows Meta's formatting guidelines.
  * Avoid sending messages with unsupported parameters or dangling placeholders.


Try Sending as a Different Type

  * If the format isn't supported (for example, a .zip file), upload it somewhere else (like Google Drive) and share the link instead.


## Example
    
    
    Incorrect: Sending a .zip file via WhatsApp.
    
    
    Correct: Upload the .zip file to Google Drive and send the download link in your WhatsApp message.

**Note:** Meta's WhatsApp On-Premises API error reference has been retired following the On-Premises API sunset (October 23, 2025). For current error and media guidance, refer to Meta's Cloud API documentation on the WhatsApp Business Platform instead.

## Summary

The error "Message type is currently not supported" means WhatsApp cannot process the format of the message you are sending. To resolve:

  * Stick to supported file types and formats.
  * Use approved templates for outbound messaging.
  * Avoid unsupported formats like stickers, GIFs, and zipped files.
