Snippets are reusable message blocks for use within the 24-hour WhatsApp customer service window. This article explains how to send snippets from Conversations and Workflows, and describes the updated WhatsApp template handling: you can now preview templates at send time (with category and language metadata) and replace template media with a single click from local files. These improvements apply in Conversations and Bulk Actions.

## **Overview**

  


Snippets are saved text or multimedia blocks you can insert into active WhatsApp conversations for faster, consistent replies. WhatsApp Templates (pre-approved messages) are separate and used to message contacts outside the 24-hour window.

  


Recent updates:  
  


  * Templates can be **previewed at runtime** inside the conversation composer and Bulk Actions.  
  


  * Template **category** and **language** are displayed during selection.  
  


  * Template **media** can be **replaced in one click** from local files.  
  


  * New UI experience may be available behind Labs.


  


> **Note:** To enable the updated Pipelines/UI features (if offered via Labs), go to **Sub-account → Labs**. (This T3 update for templates is expected to be available by default but check Labs if you don’t see the UI.)

## **Step-by-step — Sending Snippets, Previewing Templates, and Replacing Media**

  


### **Step 1 — __**_Prepare the Snippet or Template_  
  


  1. Go to **Marketing → Templates (Snippets)**.  
  


  2. Click **Add Template (Snippet)** → **Add Text Template (Snippet)** to create a snippet, or edit an existing snippet.  
  


  3. Save the snippet with a clear name for quick selection.

###   
**Step 2 —** _Send a Snippet from Conversations_  
  


  1. Go to **Conversations**.  
  


  2. Open an active WhatsApp conversation with the contact. (There must be a message from the contact within the last 24 hours.)  
  


  3. Ensure **WhatsApp** is selected as the channel.  
  


  4. Click **Insert Snippets** (or the snippets icon) in the composer.  
  


  5. Select the snippet you want; it will auto-populate the composer.  
  


  6. Edit the snippet text if necessary (you can use Custom Values or Trigger Links).  
  


  7. Click **Send**.

**Step 3 —** _Preview WhatsApp Templates at Send Time (Conversations & Bulk Actions)_  
  


  1. In the message composer (Conversations) or Bulk Actions template selection:  
  


  2. Choose **WhatsApp Template** instead of free-form or snippet.  
  


  3. The UI displays an **instant preview** of the template content.  
  


  4. The preview shows **template category** (e.g., Marketing, Utility) and **language** next to the template name.  
  


  5. Confirm the template and proceed to send or schedule.


  


Notes:  
  


  * Previewing at runtime removes the need to open WhatsApp settings to confirm template content.  
  


  * Use the preview to verify category/language before sending.

###   
**Step 4 —** _Replace Media in a WhatsApp Template (One-Click)_  
  


  1. When a selected template includes media (image, document, or video), the composer shows the media placeholder and a **Replace media** option.  
  


  2. Click **Replace media**.  
  


  3. Choose a file from your local device (file browser opens).  
  


  4. The selected media replaces the template media instantly in the composer preview.  
  


  5. Review the message and send.


  


Notes:  
  


  * This is available in **Conversations** and **Bulk Actions** where template selection occurs.  
  


  * Replacing media does not change the template itself in Meta/WhatsApp — it swaps the media at send time for that message instance.

###   
**Step 5 —** _Send Snippets or Templates via Workflows_  
  


  1. Go to **Automation → Create Workflow** (or edit an existing workflow).  
  


  2. Add an initial trigger and then add action **WhatsApp: Customer Service Window Check** to confirm the contact is within the 24-hour window.  
  


  3. Under the **Open** branch of the check, add **WhatsApp** action.  
  


  4. Choose **WhatsApp Template** if you must use a template, or choose **None – Free form message** and insert snippet content programmatically.  
  


  5. If using a template, the workflow composer will show the template preview and allow media replacement similar to Conversations.  
  


  6. Save and publish the workflow.

###   
**Step 6 —** _Bulk Actions: Send Templates and Replace Media_  
  


  1. Go to **Contacts** (or wherever Bulk Actions are available) and select the contacts you want to message.  
  


  2. Choose **Bulk Action → Send WhatsApp** (or the platform’s Bulk WhatsApp flow).  
  


  3. Select **WhatsApp Template** and use the runtime preview to verify category and language.  
  


  4. Use the **Replace media** control to swap local files if the template contains media.  
  


  5. Confirm and send the bulk operation.


  


Notes:  
  


  * Bulk Actions follow the same template preview and media-replacement UX as Conversations.  
  


  * Ensure recipients meet messaging rules (e.g., opt-in, allowed content).

##   


## **Troubleshooting & Tips**  
  


  * If you do not see the template preview or replace-media options, try refreshing the conversation UI and confirm your account supports the updated experience.  
  


  * If media replacement fails, verify file type and size meet WhatsApp and platform limits.  
  


  * Templates with strict placeholders may still require compliance with Meta’s approved structure — replacing media does not bypass template formatting rules.

## **FAQs**

  


**Q: What is a Snippet?**

Snippets are pre-defined blocks of text or multimedia saved in HighLevel that you can insert into active WhatsApp conversations for fast, consistent responses.

  


**Q: What is the difference between Snippets and WhatsApp Templates?**

WhatsApp Templates are pre-approved messages required to contact users outside the 24-hour window and must be approved by Meta/WhatsApp. Snippets are internal, editable canned responses used within the 24-hour window and do not require approval.

  


**Q: Can I preview a WhatsApp template before sending?**

Yes. Templates can now be previewed directly in the conversation composer and in Bulk Actions. The preview shows the message content along with the template’s category and language.

  


**Q: Can I replace the media inside a template at send time?**

Yes. If a template includes media, you can click Replace media and upload a file from your local device. This is available in Conversations and Bulk Actions.

  


**Q: Do snippets work outside the 24-hour window?**

No. Snippets can only be sent when the contact has an open 24-hour conversation window (i.e., an inbound message within the last 24 hours). To message outside that window, use a pre-approved WhatsApp template.

  


**Q: Does replacing media change the saved template?**

No. Replacing media swaps the media for that send instance only. The stored template remains unchanged and still reflects the original approved content.

  


**Q: Where do I enable the new UI features if I don’t see them?**

Check **Sub-account → Labs** for optional UI updates. If your account does not expose an option and you still don’t see the behavior, contact Support for account-level verification.
