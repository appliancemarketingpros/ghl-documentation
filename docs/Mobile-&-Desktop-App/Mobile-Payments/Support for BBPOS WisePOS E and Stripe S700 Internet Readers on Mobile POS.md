# **What Are Stripe Internet Readers?**

  


Stripe Internet Readers are standalone payment terminals that connect to your phone or tablet over local Wi-Fi. Because they’re internet-connected, every tap, insert, or swipe flows directly through Stripe’s PCI-certified infrastructure for end-to-end encryption. Pairing them with HighLevel turns any iOS or Android device into a countertop-to-mobile checkout station.

## **Taking a Payment With a Registered Reader**

****

Once paired, selecting a reader is as easy as choosing a card-on-file.

  


  1. Start a sale in the POS and add items to the cart.  
  

  2. On Payment Instruments, choose the reader you want to use.  
  

  3. Present the reader to the customer. They can tap, insert, or swipe. A 5-minute timer counts down on the mobile screen.  
  

  4. Wait for confirmation. The reader shows “Approved,” and the sale appears instantly in Transaction History.

## **Troubleshooting & Best Practices**

****

Use these quick fixes to keep every lane moving.

  


Symptom| Fix  
---|---  
Reader not found| Verify both devices are on the same SSID; restart the reader; ensure ports 443 & 4070 are open.  
Pairing code expired| Codes last 60 seconds—generate a new one on the reader and try again.  
Payment timer expired| Relaunch the sale; ask the customer to keep the card in place until the beep.  
Need to move readers between stores| Unpair in Payment Devices, then repeat the pairing steps on the new Wi-Fi network.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

**Q: How many internet readers can I register in one sub-account?**

**Q: Can customers add a tip on the reader?**  
Yes. Enable Prompt for Tip under POS Settings → Gratuity.

**Q: Can I refund these payments from the web app?**
