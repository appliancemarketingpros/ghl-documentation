## **Merchant Onboarding Process**

Merchant onboarding primarily occurs through the **HighLevel web app** :

  1. The main account owner adds merchants as **sub-accounts**.

  2. Each merchant connects their **Stripe** or**Square account** via the web interface.

  3. Merchants then sign in to the **mobile app using sub-account credentials** to start accepting payments directly into their Stripe accounts.


  


This structure ensures a smooth and independent onboarding process for each merchant.

  


### **Review Process**

  


Apple reviews each request based on the provided details and eligibility.

Once approved, the **Tap to Pay entitlement** will appear under your account’s **Managed Capabilities**.
