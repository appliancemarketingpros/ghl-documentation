## **How to Submit a New API-Related Idea to HighLevel**

  

    
    
    **Please Note** : Our API Docs list all available endpoints that are publicly available. If you don’t see an endpoint on either of the API developer sites listed below, we recommend visiting our [GitHub Issues page](<https://github.com/GoHighLevel/highlevel-api-docs>) to submit your request.**  
    **

## **Differences Between API Access Across Plan Levels**

**  
**

Basic API access is included with our Starter and Unlimited plans, while Advanced API access is available on our Agency Pro plan.

  


In addition to the future endpoints that will be released in our OAuth 2.0 API (which is only available in our Advanced API access), this tier unlocks the use of Agency API Keys, where lower plan levels only access Location API Keys.

## **What are the Rate Limits for API 1.0 & API 2.0?**

  


GHL has implemented rate limits on our public V2 APIs using OAuth to ensure optimal performance and stability. These limits have been adjusted to:

  


**Burst limit** : A maximum of 100 API requests per 10 seconds for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).

  


**Daily limit** : 200,000 API requests per day for each Marketplace app (i.e., client) per resource (i.e., Location or Company).

  


These new limits contribute to better overall performance and stability of our system.

  


  


To monitor your limited usage, refer to the following API response headers:

  


  * **'X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily':** Your daily limit  
  

  * **'X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining':** The remaining number of requests for the day  
  

  * **'X-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds'** : The time interval for burst requests  
  

  * **'X-RateLimit-Max':** The maximum request limit in the specified time interval  
  

  * **'X-RateLimit-Remaining':** The remaining number of requests in the current time interval.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q. What is the HighLevel API used for?**

The HighLevel API allows developers to build custom integrations, automate workflows, and connect external applications with the HighLevel platform. It provides REST endpoints for contacts, conversations, calendars, workflows, payments, and more.

###   


**Q. Does HighLevel still support API V1?**

No. HighLevel API V1 has reached end-of-support. While existing integrations may continue to function, no updates or technical support are provided. Developers should migrate to API V2 for ongoing support and new features.

  


  


**Q. What authentication methods does the HighLevel API support?**

HighLevel supports:

  


  * Private Integration Tokens for internal or single-location integrations  
  

  * OAuth 2.0 for public integrations and Marketplace apps requiring user authorization


  


  


**Q. When should I use OAuth 2.0 instead of a Private Integration Token?**

Use OAuth 2.0 when:

  


  * Building a public or Marketplace app  
  

  * Accessing multiple locations or accounts  
  

  * Requiring secure, user-approved access  
  


Private Integration Tokens are best for internal tools or single-account use cases.

HighLevel enforces:

  


  * 100 requests per 10 seconds (per resource)

Rate limit headers are included in API responses to help track usage.

No. HighLevel Support does not provide hands-on API development or debugging assistance. For help, developers should:

  * Review the official API documentation
