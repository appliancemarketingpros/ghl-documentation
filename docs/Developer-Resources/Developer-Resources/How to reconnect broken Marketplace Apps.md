In case developers lose access to access token or refresh token due to any reason - either due to an incident from HighLevel or due to an error on the developer's end - we have provided a solution.

  


You can now use the **Reconnect API** to get back the authorisation code that can be used in [Get Access Token API](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/00d0c0ecaa369-get-access-token>) (OAuth - Authorisation grant flow) to get back a new set of access and refresh tokens. 

This enables you to reinstate the connection without having to trouble your users.

  
For Sub-Account App connections:
    
    
    curl --location 'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/reconnect' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "clientKey": "<client_id>",
        "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
        "locationId": "<locationID where the app was installed>"
    }'

  


For Agency connections:
    
    
    curl --location 'https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/oauth/reconnect' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
        "clientKey": "<client_id>",
        "clientSecret": "<client_secret>",
        "companyId": "<company where the app was installed>"
    }'

  


Response of the API:
    
    
    {
        "authorizationCode": "<auth_code>",
        "expiresAt": "2024-10-08T13:35:43.887Z",
        "traceId": "trace-ID-ref"
    }
