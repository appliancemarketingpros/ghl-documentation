## **What is the HighLevel PHP & Python SDK?**

  


HighLevel’s officially supported gohighlevel/api-client (PHP) and gohighlevel-api-client (Python) libraries wrap the entire v2 Public API. Each SDK automates OAuth 2.0 token exchange, rotation, uninstall cleanup, and even marketplace bulk-installs—letting you focus on features instead of authentication plumbing.

## **Key Benefits of HighLevel SDKs**

  


  * One-line OAuth 2.0: exchange, store, and refresh tokens behind the scenes.  
  

  * Database-agnostic session storage adapters (Memory, MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, etc.).  
  

  * Webhook helpers validate signatures and process INSTALL / UNINSTALL events automatically.  
  

  * Typed service methods for every public endpoint, cutting boilerplate and runtime errors.  
  

  * Auto-generated with each API release—your client stays current without manual updates.


* * *

## **Supported OAuth 2.0 Workflows**

  


A flexible token engine covers every installation path developers meet.

  


  * Sub-account installs via the Marketplace “Connect” button  
  

  * Bulk agency installs (all locations at once)  
  

  * Future auto-installs when new sub-accounts are created  
  

  * Daily silent refresh before expiry and graceful uninstall cleanup


* * *

## **Database-Agnostic Token Storage**

  


Pluggable storage adapters keep tokens safe wherever you already persist data. Swap in:

  


  * In-memory cache for local dev  
  

  * MongoDB, Redis, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or your own class implementing the storage interface 


* * *

## **SDK Auto-Generation**

  


Both clients rebuild automatically from the OpenAPI spec each time HighLevel releases new endpoints or fields, so you can update with a simple composer update or pip install --upgrade. 

  


The SDK aims to abstract the complexity of implementing OAuth 2.0 away from developers, fully managing tokens for them across all scenarios.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I still need to refresh tokens manually?**

No. Once session storage is configured, the SDK refreshes tokens silently before they expire.

  


  


**Q: Can I store tokens in MySQL instead of MongoDB?**

Yes. Extend the provided storage base class with your own create/read/update logic.

  


  


**Q: Does the SDK support Private Integration Tokens (PIT)?**

Absolutely—pass privateIntegrationToken when you don’t need OAuth flows.

  


  


**Q: How do I validate webhook signatures?**

Use client.webhooks.subscribe() in Python or getWebhookManager()->verifySignature() in PHP.

  


  


**Q: Is the SDK compatible with HighLevel’s v1 endpoints?**

No. The SDK targets Public API v2 only.

  


  


**Q: Will updates break my code?**

New releases are semver-tagged; breaking changes trigger a major version bump so you can pin and upgrade deliberately.
