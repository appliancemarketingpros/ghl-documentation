Assigning user type and role

## **Restrict access to specific sub-accounts**

  
Agency admins can assign agency admins to specific sub-accounts and restrict them from accessing other sub-accounts to which they are not assigned. 

  
For example, Alex, who is an agency admin, can access only assigned sub-accounts '78th Avenue' and 'A Mailbox NYC', without compromising his access level. However, he will not be able to access 'Baker's Inn' which he is not assigned to.

## **Assign Permissions**

  


Agency admins can apply granular permissions to their users. You may control the permissions at two levels:  
  


  * **Module:** Toggle the module off to completely restrict access to the module.  
  

  * **Granular:** Using checboxes, you can set the permissions at a granular level.


  
The new permissions structure is backward compatible with the old set of permission structures and their functionalities.

### **Sub-Account Settings (Granular Permissions)**

  
As agencies grow, you may want to delegate sub-account administration without granting full access to sensitive settings. Sub-Account Settings permissions let you control who can view, edit, or manage key areas across sub-accounts.

  
Where these permissions apply  
  


  * Sub-Accounts List Page: Control who can view and manage sub-accounts.  
  

  * Manage Client Page (Basic Details): Limit access to client-level configuration.  
  

  * Sub-Account Billing: Restrict billing and financial actions at the sub-account level.  
  

  * Sub-Account Company Settings: Restrict access to high-impact company configuration settings.

### 
    
    
    When a user tries to access a restricted area or perform a restricted action, HighLevel displays contextual messaging explaining that the action is not allowed for their permission level.

## **Steps to Stop a User From Opening New Sub-accounts  
**

  
Creating brand-new sub-accounts is not controlled by the list above. It’s an Agency-level permission.  
  


  1. Go to Agency view → Settings → Team  
  

  2. Open the user → Roles & Permissions  
  

  3. Find Sub-Accounts (Agency module)  
  

  4. Uncheck “Create Sub-Accounts” (and “Delete” if needed)  
  

  5. Tggle Sub-Accounts = Off to hide it completely


  


### **User Management → Login As**

  


Enable Login As controls whether an agency admin can impersonate another user via Login As.

  


  * **Default:** Enabled.  
  

  * **Effect when disabled:** The Login As option is hidden for that admin.  
  
**Where:** Agency Settings › Team › Edit user › Roles & Permissions › User Management.

## **Copy Permissions**

  


Agency admins can copy a user’s granular permissions to another user. For example, when Bob joins the sales team, the admin can clone Alex’s permissions to Bob.

## **Adding Clients to a Sub-Account with Limited Access**

  
Clients should not be added as agency-level users. Instead, they should be added directly within the sub-account associated with their business, where you can assign specific permissions and roles tailored to their needs. Adding clients at the agency level will give them unnecessary visibility across all sub-accounts—something you likely want to avoid.  
  
  
Follow these steps to add a client to a sub-account and control their permissions:  
  


  * Go to the sub-account associated with the client.  
  

  * Navigate to Settings > My Staff.  
  

  * Click the blue button labeled + Add Employee in the upper right corner and enter the client’s user details.  
  

  * Enter your client’s name + email and set their Role (usually User; use Admin only if they truly need full control).  
  

  * Set permissions based on what they should be able to edit (you can toggle modules on/off and adjust individual permissions).  
  

  * Enable the Only Assigned Data toggle if you want the client to see only the records (contacts, calendars, opportunities) assigned to them.  
  

  * Click Save to finalize their access level.  
  

  * Dashboard → Export data: Allows the user to export dashboard widget data for reporting.

## **U ser Management API support**

  


The User Management permissions supports API-based updates when Enhanced Security is disabled. Use this option when your agency manages users through API-first workflows or high-volume operational processes.

  


Supported User Management permission levels:

  


**View & Manage Users: **Allows users to view, create, and edit users.

**View Users:** Allows users to view users only.

  


To enable API-based user-management updates, from **Agency** level go to Settings > Company > Advanced Settings and disable Enhanced Security.
