## Overview

The **Update Company or Associated Contact** action allows you to automatically update details for a **Company record** or an **Associated Contact** within a Company-based workflow.

  


It’s designed to help you maintain accurate CRM data by dynamically updating company or contact information whenever related events or triggers occur—such as webhook updates, form submissions, or record changes.

  


## Action Name

Update Company or Associated Contact

  


## Action Description

Use this action to:

  * Automatically update an existing **Company record** or an **Associated Contact** linked to a company.

  * Map workflow fields, webhook parameters, or fixed text values to update existing CRM fields.

  * Correct or enrich company and contact data based on incoming automation triggers.

  * Streamline data management across your company-based workflows.


  


This action modifies existing records—it does **not** create new records.  
For creating new entries, use the **Create Company or Associated Contact** action instead.

I. **Object Record to Update**

  * Choose whether you want to update the:

    * **Company** : to modify the current company record in the workflow.

    * **Associated Contact** : to update contact details for one or more contacts linked to that company.


II. **Field Mapping**

  * Map data from workflow sources to the fields you want to update.

  * Example mappings:

    * _Company Industry : {{inboundWebhookRequest.body.industry}}_

    * _Contact Phone : {{inboundWebhookRequest.body.phone}}_

    * _Contact Role : {{inboundWebhookRequest.body.role}}_


III. **Dynamic Value Sources**  
You can use dynamic values from:

  * **Inbound Webhook payloads** (e.g., `{{inboundWebhookRequest.body.companyName}}`).

  * **Company fields** (from the record that triggered the workflow).

  * **Fixed text values** (e.g., “Active”, “Updated by Workflow”).


IV. **Add Field**

  * Use **\+ Add Field** to update multiple fields at once.

  * Each row represents a field-value pair to be updated.


V. **Update Behavior**

  * When updating **Associated Contacts** , the action will only update contacts currently linked to the workflow’s company record.

  * If no matching associated contacts exist, the action will skip automatically.


VI. **Save Action**

  * Click **Save Action** to confirm.

  * When the workflow runs, the selected fields will be updated based on the latest values in the workflow context.


VII. **Edge Cases & Notes**

  * This action is **available only in Company-based workflows**.

  * It cannot create new records—use **Create Company or Associated Contact** for that.

  * Ensure correct field mappings to prevent overwriting critical information.
