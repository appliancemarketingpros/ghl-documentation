## Overview

The **Clear Fields of Company or Associated Contact** action allows workflow users to **reset or remove field values** from either the **Company record** or the **Contact associated with that company** , directly within a **Company-based workflow**.

This is useful for maintaining clean and accurate CRM data — for example, removing outdated phone numbers, clearing old tags, or resetting a contact’s status when a company’s relationship changes.

  


## Action Name

  * Automatically clear selected fields from either the **Company record** or the **associated Contact(s)** in a Company-based workflow.

  * Keep data accurate and up to date by removing stale, incorrect, or obsolete values.

I. **Clear a Field From the Object Record**

  * Choose which object you want to clear fields from:

    * **Company** – Clears fields from the current company record.

    * **Associated Contact** – Clears fields from the contacts associated with that company.


II. **Add Fields**

  * Use the dropdown to select one or more fields to clear.

  * Supported fields include all editable standard and custom fields on the selected object.

  * Use the **\+ Add Field** option to clear multiple fields at once.


III. **Clear Behavior**

  * When executed, the selected fields will be reset (emptied) for the chosen record type (Company or Contact).

  * If there are no associated contacts, the action will automatically **skip**.

  * Clearing does not remove associations or delete related data — only the selected field values are reset.


IV. **Save Action**

  * After selecting all fields to be cleared, click **Save Action.**

  * When the workflow runs, the chosen fields in the Company or associated Contacts will be cleared automatically.


V. **Edge Cases & Notes**

  * Available only in **Company-based workflows.**

  * To clear fields in Contact-based workflows, use **Clear Associated Company Fields.**

  * If multiple associated contacts exist, all selected fields will be cleared for each of them.
