## **What is DND Contact Workflow Action?**

  


The "**DND Contact** " action allows you to manage the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) settings for a contact. This action can enable or disable DND across all communication channels or specific ones, and for either Inbound or Outbound direction. 

  


It’s useful for ensuring that contacts are not disturbed by automated messages when they have requested not to be contacted, or for blocking unwanted inbound communication from specific contacts.

## **Some Triggers which can be used with the action (But not limited to)**

  


  * **Appointment Status Changed:**  
  


    * **Trigger:** Use the "Appointment Status Changed" trigger.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Set a filter for the appointment status to be "Completed" or "Showed" (depending on the terminology used in your system).  
  

    * **Action:** Add the "DND Contact" action to disable DND, indicating that the contact can now receive communications.  
  

  * **Appointment Scheduled:**  
  


    * **Trigger:** Use the "Appointment Scheduled" trigger.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Add a condition to wait for a specific period after the appointment time (e.g., 1 hour after the scheduled end time).  
  

    * **Action:** After the waiting period, add the "DND Contact" action to disable DND, assuming the appointment has been completed.  
  

  * **Task Completed:**  
  


    * **Trigger:** Use the "Task Completed" trigger associated with appointment follow-up tasks.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Link the task to follow-up actions post-appointment, such as sending a thank you email or a survey.  
  

    * **Action:** Once the task is marked as completed, add the "DND Contact" action to disable DND, allowing communication to resume.  
  

  * **Custom Field Update:**  
  


    * **Trigger:** Use a "Custom Field Update" trigger where a field is updated to indicate the appointment's completion.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Create a custom field that is marked when the appointment is considered completed (manually or via another process).  
  

    * **Action:** When this field is updated, use the "DND Contact" action to disable DND.  
  

  * **Manual Trigger via Internal Notification:**  
  


    * **Trigger:** Set up a process where team members manually update a contact's record or status after verifying appointment completion.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Use an internal notification or task completion as a trigger.  
  

    * **Action:** Use the "DND Contact" action to disable DND for the contact.  
  

  * **Contact Created (Inbound Spam Blocking):**
    * **Trigger:** Use the "Contact Created" trigger when a contact is created via inbound call or SMS.  
  

    * **Configuration:** Add conditions to identify spam patterns (e.g., phone number format, lack of engagement, or known spam indicators).  
  

    * **Action:** Use the "DND Contact" action with DND Direction set to Inbound to block future incoming calls and SMS from the contact.


* * *

## **Logging and attribution**

  


When this workflow action enables or disables DND, HighLevel records it in Conversations and activity logs as:

  


  * **DND Enabled by Workflows**  
  

  * **DND Disabled by Workflows**


  


If DND is changed manually by a team member, logs show DND Enabled/Disabled by User. If the contact changes DND, logs show DND Enabled/Disabled by Contact. This applies across all channels.

## **Example**

  


**Scenario:** A customer has opted out of receiving promotional SMS but wants to stay updated via email.  
  


  1. Set up a workflow trigger when a contact opts out of SMS communication.
  2. Add the "DND Contact" action.
  3. Configure it to enable DND for SMS only while keeping other channels active.
  4. This setup ensures the contact will not receive SMS notifications but can still receive updates via email or other preferred channels.


  


This approach respects customer preferences and helps maintain a positive relationship by avoiding unwanted communications.

  


**Scenario** : A marketing agency wants to block incoming spam calls from cluttering their pipeline with junk contacts.  
  


  1. Set up a workflow trigger when a contact is identified as spam (via custom field, tag, or manual process).
  2. Add the "DND Contact" action.
  3. Configure it to enable DND for all channels with Direction set to Inbound.
  4. This setup blocks incoming calls and SMS from the contact, preventing them from creating noise in your system.  
  


This approach helps agencies maintain clean pipelines by filtering out unwanted inbound traffic.
