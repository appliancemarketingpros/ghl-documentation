## Overview

The **Clear Associated Company Fields** action allows you to automatically **remove or reset field values** from the **Company record associated with a Contact** in a workflow.

  


Use this action to clear outdated company information such as tags, addresses, or custom fields that no longer apply.

  


## Action Name

Clear Associated Company Fields

  


## Action Description

Use this action to:

  * Automatically clear or reset selected **Company fields** linked to a Contact.

  * Remove outdated or irrelevant information such as tags, locations, or custom statuses.

  * Maintain data accuracy when a contact changes companies or disengages.


This action clears existing values from the specified fields—it **does not delete the company record** or break the association.

  


For editing field values instead of clearing them, use the **Update Associated Company** action.

  


## Action Details

I. **Select Fields to Clear**

  * Choose one or more fields from the associated Company record that should be cleared.

  * You can select standard fields (e.g., _Industry_ , _Domain_ , _Address_) or custom fields created in your CRM.


II. **Multiple Field Selection**

  * You can clear multiple fields in a single action by adding them to the list.

  * Example: Clear _Tags_ , _Address_ , and _Website_ simultaneously.


III. **Clear Behavior**

  * The action clears the selected field values for the **Company associated with the Contact** that triggered the workflow.

  * If no associated company exists, the action will **be skipped automatically.**


IV. **Save Action**

  * After selecting fields, click **Save Action.**

  * When the workflow runs, the chosen fields in the linked company record will be reset (emptied).


V. **Edge Cases & Notes**

  * Available **only in Contact-based workflows.**

  * This action cannot clear contact fields — only company fields linked to the contact.

  * If the contact has multiple company associations, the action targets the **primary associated company**
