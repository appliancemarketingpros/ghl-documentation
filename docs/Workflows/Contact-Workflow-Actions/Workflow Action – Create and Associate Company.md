## Overview

The **Create and Associate Company** action allows you to automatically create a new **Company record** and associate it with the trigger **Contact** in your workflow.

  


This action helps eliminate manual data entry by linking Contacts and Companies automatically, keeping your CRM structured and up-to-date.

  


## Action Name

Create and Associate Company

  


## Action Description

Use this action to:

  * Automatically create a **new Company record** from a Contact workflow.

  * Link the newly created Company to the **trigger Contact** through an association.

  * Map fields dynamically using data from the contact record, workflow variables, or inbound webhooks.

  * Maintain organized company-contact relationships without manual creation.


This action ensures that each contact is linked to a relevant company, making it especially useful for B2B onboarding, form submissions, or enrichment workflows.

I. **Field Mapping**

  * Map workflow variables or fixed values to populate the new Company’s fields.

  * Example mappings:

    * Company Name → `{{contact.company_name}}`

    * Domain → `{{inboundWebhookRequest.body.domain}}`

    * Industry → `{{contact.industry}}`


II. **Dynamic Value Sources**  
You can map values from:

  * **Contact fields** (e.g., First Name, Company Name, Email).

  * **Inbound Webhook payloads** (e.g., `{{inboundWebhookRequest.body.company}}`).

  * **Fixed text values** (e.g., “New Lead Company”).


III. **Association Behavior**

  * The new Company record created by this action will automatically be **associated with the Contact** that triggered the workflow.

  * The relationship will appear under both the **Contact’s “Associated Companies”** section and the **Company’s “Associated Contacts”** section in the CRM.


IV. **Add Field**

  * Use **\+ Add Field** to map additional Company fields.

  * Each row represents a field–value pair that defines how the Company record is created.


V. **Save Action**

  * Once all required mappings are set, click **Save Action**.

  * When the workflow runs, it will create the new Company record and associate it with the Contact automatically.


VI. **Edge Cases & Notes**

  * This action is **only available in Contact-based workflows.**

  * If the Contact already has a linked Company, this will create an additional Company but will not be associated with the contact
