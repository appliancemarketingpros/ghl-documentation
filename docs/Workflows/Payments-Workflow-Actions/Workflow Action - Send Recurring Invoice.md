## **Recurring Invoice Action Configuration Settings**

  


The Send Recurring Invoice action is highly customizable. This section breaks down each option so you can tailor billing to fit any plan before you click Publish.

  


  


#### **Start Date Options**

  


The **Start Date** dropdown lets you choose when the schedule begins, ensuring invoices reach customers at the right moment.

  


  * **Action Date:** begins the schedule as soon as the contact hits the workflow trigger (e.g., tag added or contact changed)  
  


  * **Fixed Date:** aligns billing with a specific calendar day (e.g., 1 July, 2025)


  


  


#### **End Criteria and Stop Rules**

  


The **Stop** dropdown controls when the schedule ends, preventing over‑billing or unintended charges.

  


  * **Never:** continues until manually stopped  
  


  * **After X Occurrences:** perfect for installment plans (e.g., 12 monthly payments).


  


  


#### **Recurrence Frequencies**

  


The **Frequency** dropdown determines how often invoices repeat and displays extra selectors (e.g., weekday, month) based on your choice.

  


  * Daily: every _N_ days—ideal for high‑frequency payments  
  


  * Weekly: send on a specific weekday or on the action date—great for weekly coaching  
  


  * Monthly: by date or by week (e.g., 2nd Wednesday)—common for memberships and retainers  
  


  * Yearly: choose month and day, every _N_ years—ideal for annual renewals


  


  


#### **Auto‑Pay**

  


Toggle **Enable Auto‑Payment** to charge it automatically after the first successful payment, streamlining collection.  
  


  * Gateway Requirement: currently supported with Stripe‑connected sub‑accounts  
  


  * First Invoice Must Succeed: card details are stored only after a successful manual payment
