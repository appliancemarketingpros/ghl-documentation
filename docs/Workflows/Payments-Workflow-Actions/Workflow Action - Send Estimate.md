# **What is the Send Estimate Workflow Action**

  


The Send Estimate action automatically generates an estimate from an estimate template and delivers it to a contact through the channel you choose (Email or Text). It’s designed for pipeline‑driven sales motions where proposals must go out consistently, with proper branding, taxes, and totals without manual effort.

  


In short, once a workflow reaches this action, HighLevel builds an estimate from your chosen template, fills in available contact/opportunity details, and sends it to the contact using your selected sender and channel.

## **Key Benefits of Send Estimate Action**

  


  * **Speed to proposal:** Send estimates instantly when a lead reaches a specific stage, submits a form, or requests pricing.  
  


  * **Consistency & branding:** Ensure every estimate uses the correct template, logos, taxes, and currency—no ad‑hoc PDFs.  
  


  * **Channel flexibility:** Deliver by **Email** or **SMS** based on the contact data you have and their preferred communication.  
  


  * **Audit-ability:** Keep a record of when each estimate was sent, viewed, accepted, and paid.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

  


Getting these items ready avoids delivery failures and template mismatch issues that slow down sales.

  


  * Payments is enabled for the location and a payment processor is connected.  
  


  * At least one **Estimate Template** is created and active (branding, taxes, currency set).  
  


  * The contact has a valid **Email** and/or **Phone** based on your selected channel.  
  


  * Email sending domain is verified and compliant; SMS sending is compliant and the contact is opted in.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: What happens if the contact has both email and phone?**

**Q: Which user identity is used to send the estimate?**

The From User you select. If that user is deactivated later, update the action to an active sender.
