## Overview

The **Company Changed** trigger starts a workflow whenever selected fields in a **Company record** are updated. This trigger allows you to react instantly to changes in company details, ensuring that automations stay in sync with the most up-to-date data.

## Trigger Name

Company Changed

  


  


## Trigger Description

This trigger runs when:

  * A **Company record** is updated.

  * The update matches one or more field conditions you configure in the trigger.


You can choose **specific fields** to monitor (e.g., Industry, Status, Domain). When those fields change, the workflow automatically begins.

  * **Add the Trigger**

    * Choose **Company Changed** as your workflow trigger.

  * **Select Fields to Monitor**

    * Pick one or more Company fields (standard or custom) to track for changes.

    * Example: Industry, Domain, Status.

  * **Apply Operators**

    * For each field, choose an operator:

      * **Is not empty** – fires when the field has any value.

      * **Contains Phrase** – fires when the field value contains a specified keyword/phrase.

  * **Add Multiple Filters (Optional)**

    * Combine filters using **AND logic** (all conditions must be met for the trigger to fire).

  * **Save the Trigger**

    * Once saved, the workflow will automatically enroll Companies whenever they meet your configured conditions.
