## Overview

  


The "Start IVR Trigger" in HighLevel enables you to create and manage interactive voice response (IVR) systems within your workflows. This trigger allows you to initiate a multi-step voice menu that guides callers through various options, ensuring they reach the correct department or receive the desired information efficiently. Voicemail cannot be tracked using IVR trigger

  


## Trigger Name

  


Start IVR Trigger

  


## Trigger Description

  


The Start IVR Trigger is designed to launch an IVR sequence when a specified event occurs, such as an inbound call to your business to the IVR phone number. This trigger helps automate the routing of calls, allowing callers to interact with pre-recorded voice prompts and navigate through options using their phone keypad.

  


## How to Configure

  


**Prerequisites**

Before using the **Start IVR Trigger** , make sure your sub‑account meets the following requirements:

  * Your sub‑account must be subscribed to an **LC Phone** plan.

  * The phone number used for IVR must be configured under your **LC Phone** setup.

  * An IVR configuration must be created before it can be triggered inside a workflow.


**Important:** IVR features are only available for accounts with an active **LC Phone** plan. If your sub‑account is not on an LC Phone plan, the **Start IVR Trigger** will not function for inbound call routing

  


**Step by Step Guide**

  * **Choose the Action Type:** Select "Start IVR Trigger" from the list of available triggers.
  * **Name Your Action:** Enter a descriptive name for the workflow trigger name, such as "Trigger IVR call".
  * **Configure the trigger** to be activated by an inbound call and choose the phone number.
  * **Add custom fields** in filters as required.
  * **Save and Activate:** Save the trigger and activate it to start using the IVR system for inbound calls.


  


**Note** : Once a phone number is mapped to a IVR workflow it cannot be mapped to any other IVR workflow

##   


## Example

  


**Scenario:** You want to set up an IVR system that directs callers to the correct department within your company.

  1. **Create Workflow Trigger:**

     * Set the "Start IVR" trigger to activate when any inbound call is received on your main business line.
  2. **Choose Tigger name and filters.**

  3. **Within the Filters,** add an inbound phone number for which the IVR will get activated.

  4. **Save and Activate:**

     * Finalize your IVR setup and activate the workflow. Now, any inbound calls will trigger the IVR system.
