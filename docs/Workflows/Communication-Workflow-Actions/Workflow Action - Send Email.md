**2.** **Configure the Action Name**

  


Assign a clear, descriptive name for the action (e.g., “Booking Confirmation Email”). This helps you easily identify the action in the workflow.

**3\. Fill in Sender Details**

  


  * From Name: Enter the name that will appear as the sender (e.g., “My Company”).  
  

  * From Email: Input the email address from which the email will be sent (e.g., “mycompany@email.com”).

**4.Create the Subject Line**

**5\. Choose or Create the Email Body**

  


  * **Templates:** Select an email template from the dropdown (optional). If no template is available, you can write a custom message in the Email Body field.

**Email Body :** Create your email body here. Use custom values to personalize the message. For example:

Hi {{contact.first_name}}, Thank you for booking with us! Your appointment is scheduled for {{appointment.start_time}}.

  


If you select an existing template, you may see a **Sync Edits to Template** checkbox. When sync is ON, changes in the workflow email and the original template update each other. When sync is OFF, they stay independent.

## **Troubleshooting**

  


  * **Email didn’t send:** Confirm the contact has a valid email address and that your sender email/domain is set up correctly.  
  


  * **Merge fields showing as blank:** Ensure the contact/trigger provides those values (e.g., appointment fields require an appointment-related trigger).  
  


  * **Formatting looks off:** Use a test email to validate spacing, links, and templates across email clients.


* * *

## **Tips and best practices**

  * Keep subject lines short and specific.  
  


  * Use templates for consistency across teams.  
  


  * Personalize with merge fields, but avoid relying on fields that may not exist for every trigger.  
  


  * If adding multiple CC/BCC emails, double-check comma separation.

## **FAQs**

  


**Can I use templates with this action?**

Yes. You can select an existing email template, or write a custom email directly in the editor.

  


**Can I personalize the email?**

Yes. Use custom values (merge fields) like {{contact.first_name}} to personalize the subject and body.

  


**Do CC/BCC recipients appear in workflow email stats?**

No. CC/BCC recipients do not appear in Email Stats. Workflow send success/failure is determined by the primary contact email.

  


**Does “Send Test Mail” validate CC/BCC delivery?**

No. Test emails are for validating formatting/content; they do not confirm CC/BCC delivery.

  


**What happens if a CC/BCC email address is invalid?**

Invalid CC/BCC addresses are skipped. Valid CC/BCC recipients (and the primary contact) can still receive the email.

  


**Can I add attachments?**

Yes, attachments are supported via URLs. Use this for PDFs, invoices, or other downloadable files.

  


**Why are merge fields blank in my test or live email?**

Merge fields can be blank if the workflow trigger/action context doesn’t provide that data (for example, appointment fields require an appointment-related trigger), or if the contact record is missing values.

  


**Why did my email land in spam or not deliver?**

Deliverability depends on proper sender setup and domain configuration. Verify your sending configuration and test with multiple inbox providers.
