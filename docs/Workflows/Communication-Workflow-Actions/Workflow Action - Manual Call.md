Manual Call

  


## Action Description

The Manual Call Action creates a task in Conversations > Manual Actions tab for a call to a contact manually. The task requires user intervention to call the contact. Once the task is deleted from the actions tab, the contact will move to the next action in the workflow. You can also assign the task to a specific user instead of the default contact owner using the Assign To field in Advanced Settings.

###   
**Assign To Behavior**

  


The Assign To field in Advanced Settings allows you to assign the manual call task to a specific user instead of the default contact owner. This is useful when you want a particular team member to handle certain calls regardless of who owns the contact.  
  


**Assignment logic:**

  * If a user is selected and has contact access, the task is assigned to that user.
  * If a user is selected but does not have contact access, the task falls back to the contact owner.
  * If no user is selected, the task defaults to the contact owner.
  * If neither the selected user nor contact owner is available, the task is marked as Unassigned.


  


##### ****Execution Logs:****

  * The action logs will show a manual call action with a message "Manual Call added to the manual queue". This helps in tracking the of your call.


  

    
    
    **Important:******
    The Manual Call action only progresses the workflow when the task is explicitly deleted from the Manual Actions tab. Simply calling the contact from the Contacts page or any other area will not complete the task or move the workflow forward.
