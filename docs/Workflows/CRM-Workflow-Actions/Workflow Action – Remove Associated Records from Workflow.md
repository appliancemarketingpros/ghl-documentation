## Overview

The Remove Associated Records from Workflow action is available in all workflow types — Contact-based, Company-based, and Custom Object-based workflows. It automatically **removes records that are associated to the trigger record** (via a selected object + label) from another workflow. This ensures clean unenrollment of related contacts, companies, or custom object records when conditions change.

  


This action is different from the existing [Remove from Workflow action](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002553-workflow-action-remove-from-workflow>) which only removes the current record (e.g., a contact) from a workflow. Remove Associated Records from Workflow instead allows you to unenroll associated records (Contacts, Companies, or Custom Objects) based on an association label.

  


## Action Name

Remove Associated Records From Workflow

  


## Action Description

This action enables workflow users to:

  * Select an **object type**

  * Choose an **association label** to target which associated records should be removed.

  * Pick the **workflow** the associated records will be removed from.


This action is possible only after creating custom objects (or using contacts/companies) in the sub-account and ensuring that an **association label** exists between the trigger record and the records to be removed. This includes **contact-to-contact** and **company-to-contact** associations.

  * **Select an object** : Choose the type of associated records to remove (e.g., Contacts, Dealers, Properties).

  * **Association Label** (required): Determines which associated records qualify for removal. (does not apply on company - contact associations)

  * **Workflow** : Select the target workflow the associated records will be **removed from**.

  * **Edge cases & notes**:

    * At least one matching association (by label) must exist; otherwise, no records are removed.

    * Removals are immediate; if you need to re-enroll later, use **Add Associated Records to Workflow** action or a separate automation.


  


## Examples

  


#### **Example 1: Car ↔ Dealer (Custom Object Workflow)**

  


When a **Car** record’s status changes to _Sold_ , remove its associated **Dealers** (label: _Assigned Dealer_) from the **Dealer Notification Workflow** so they stop receiving updates.

**Setup**

  * **Object** → Dealer

  * **Association Label** → Assigned Dealer

  * **Workflow** → Dealer Notification Workflow


**How It Works**

  1. Car status becomes _Sold_ (workflow trigger).

  2. Action finds Dealers associated to the Car via _Assigned Dealer_.

  3. Those Dealers are removed from the _Dealer Notification Workflow_.
