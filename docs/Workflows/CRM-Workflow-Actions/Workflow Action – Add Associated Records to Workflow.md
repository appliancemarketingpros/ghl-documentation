## Overview

The Add Associated Records to Workflow action allows users to automatically add records that are associated with the trigger object into another workflow. 

  


The Add Associated Records to Workflow action is available in all workflow types — Contact-based, Company-based, and Custom Object-based workflows. It allows users to automatically add records that are associated with the trigger record into another workflow.

  


This action extends the functionality of the existing[ Add to Workflow action](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000002554>). While _Add to Workflow_ only adds the current record (e.g., a contact) to another workflow, Add Associated Records to Workflow enables enrolling associated records (Contacts, Companies, or Custom Objects) based on an association label.

**Setup**

  * **Object** → Dealer

  * **Association Label** → Assigned Dealer

  * **Workflow** → Dealer Notification Workflow


**How It Works**

  1. A Car record is updated to _Ready for Sale_.

  2. The action finds all associated Dealers under the label _Assigned Dealer_.

  3. Each Dealer is enrolled in the **Dealer Notification Workflow** , where they receive automated alerts.
