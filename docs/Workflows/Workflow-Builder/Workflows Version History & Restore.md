## **What is Workflow Version History?**

  


Version History is HighLevel’s built-in timeline of every saved state of your workflow. Each entry records who edited it, the exact time stamp, and whether the version was a draft or published build. With the 2025 revamp, you can browse, filter, and restore past versions of a workflowin seconds, eliminating guesswork and restore any version as a new draft, your live workflow doesn’t change until you Publish. This follows the same draft → publish model used across Workflow.risky re-builds.

## **Key Benefits of Workflow Version History**

  


  * **Instant peace of mind** —jump back to any of the last 10 versions (or 30 days) in one click.  
  

  * **Team accountability** —see every editor’s includedname and the moment they saved.  
  

  * **Flexible recovery** —convert a past version into a fresh draft or an entirely new workflow.  
  

  * **Zero learning curve** —clean sidebar UI with chronological labels (v12, v13, v14…).  
  

  * **Part of the Editing Trifecta** —works alongside Auto-Save and Undo/Redo at no extra cost.


  


Use Version History to review past versions of a workflow and restore any version as a new draft, your live workflow doesn’t change until you Publish. This follows the same draft → publish model used across Workflow.

* * *

## **What’s included**

  


**Version History Revamp**

  


  * Every saved version now captures your workflow at a specific point in time — including editor, timestamp, and workflow status (Draft or Published).  
  

  * Easily browse up to 10 versions or 30 days of version history, organized and filterable by editor.


  


**Restore Previous Versions**

  


  * Click Restore beside any version to reopen it as a new draft.  
  

  * You can even create a new workflow from a previous version.


  


**Enhanced Browsing Experience**

  


  * The new Version History Sidebar gives a clean, chronological overview with quick filters and clear version labels (v12, v13, v14…).

## **How Version History is created**

  


Version History automatically records versions at key moments:

  


  * When you click Save manually  
  

  * When you confirm changes in the Unsaved Changes pop-up  
  

  * When you use Save Version in the workflow  
  

  * When the workflow status changes (e.g., Draft → Publish or Publish → Draft)  
  


**Auto Save note:** routine auto-saves do not create new versions by themselves.  
To capture your current state **as a version** , click **Save Version** —this snapshots your latest auto-saved changes into Version History.

## **Browse versions**

  


Open **Version History** to see your saved entries, organized by **time** and **editor**.

Each entry shows:

You can:

  * **Filter by editor**

  * View **up to 10 versions or 30 days** of history (whichever comes first)


* * *

## **Restore or create from a version**

  


  * Click **Restore** next to any previous version to reopen it **as a new draft**.  
  


  * Your **Published** workflow remains unchanged until you **Publish** the restored draft.  
  


  * Or choose **Create new workflow from version** to branch into a separate workflow without touching the original.

**When restoring:**

  


  * The workflow must be in **Draft**.  
  


  * There must be **no enrolled contacts** currently in the workflow.  
  


  * The restored state becomes a **new version** —all prior versions remain available.


* * *

## **How Workflow Changes Effect Contacts Already in Progress**

  


Contacts already progressing through a workflow can use updates made to upcoming actions.

  


For example, if a contact is currently in a Wait action and you update an action that comes after it, the contact uses the updated action when it reaches that step. If you add a new action after the Wait action, the contact can also execute the new action as part of the same workflow journey.

  


Changing the Wait action itself does not update the existing wait for contacts already in that step. Those contacts complete their current wait before continuing through the updated workflow.

* * *

## **Best practices**

  


  * Name versions at milestones (e.g., “Added enterprise branch,” “Updated welcome sequence”).  
  

  * Coordinate editors—use Save Version before large changes.  
  

  * Use Preview / Compare to validate differences before restoring.  
  

  * Branch safely with Create new workflow from version when you want to explore big ideas without touching the current build.


* * *

## **Notes & limitations**

  


  * **Draft → Publish:** Restoring creates a **new draft**. You must **Publish** to push it live.  
  


  * **Undo/Redo resets after restore.** Once you restore a version, your session history starts fresh from that draft.  
  


  * **Auto Save scope:** Auto Save covers **canvas** edits; some configuration panel edits may still require their own save/apply (v1).  
  


  * **Retention:** Version History keeps **up to 10 versions or 30 days**  
  


  * **Validation to restore:** Workflow must be **Draft** with **no enrolled contacts**.  
  


  * **Availability:** At launch, **Version History** is available via **Labs Beta**. Enable it in **Settings → Labs** for your account.
