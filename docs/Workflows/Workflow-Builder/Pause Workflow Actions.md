Temporarily disable any action in a workflow without deleting or disconnecting it. This makes testing, debugging, and iterating safer and faster, then re-enable the step when you’re ready.

## **What are Pause Workflow Actions?**

  


Pause Workflow Actions lets you temporarily turn workflow nodes on or off inside the Advanced Builder and Standard Builder. Disabled nodes are skipped during execution, allowing you to debug, A/B-test, or iterate without losing your original setup.

  


  * **Pause without breaking:** Turn off individual nodes to test variations or isolate issues.  
  

  * **Non-destructive:** Your wiring stays intact—no need to remove or rebuild connections.  
  

  * **Clear visuals:** Disabled steps are dimmed on the canvas and are skipped at run time.

## **Key Benefits of Pause Workflow Actions**

  


Pause Workflow Actions delivers powerful quality-of-life upgrades:

  


  * **Works in both builders:** Pause Workflow Actions is available in both the Advanced Builder and the Standard Builder, so you can use the same testing and troubleshooting workflow no matter which builder you prefer.  
**  
**
  * **Faster testing:** Disable a step, run the workflow, and re-enable instantly.  
  

  * **Zero rebuilds:** Your configurations stay intact; no need to re-map paths.  
  

  * **Clean execution:** HighLevel automatically skips disabled nodes so contacts never stall.  
  

  * **Safer iteration:** Debug or A/B-test without affecting production logic.


* * *

## **Enable/Disable Toggle**

  


Hover over any node in the Advanced or Standard Builder to reveal an Enable/Disable switch. Toggling it off greys-out the node and adds a “Disabled” label; toggling back on restores normal color and execution. Disabled nodes are fully ignored during live runs. 

* * *

## **Visual Indicators & Execution Behavior**

  


  * Appears greyed out with a Disabled tag.  
  

  * **Disabled nodes** : Are skipped automatically even when they’re the only forward path—so downstream actions still fire.  
  

  * **Enabled nodes** : Execute exactly as configured after reactivation.


* * *

## **How does the Pause Workflow Action Work**

  


  * **Enable/Disable toggle:** Hover a node and click on the pause icon.  
  

  * **Canvas cues:** Disabled nodes appear dimmed to signal they won’t run.  
  

  * **Execution:** Disabled nodes are skipped during workflow execution.  
  

  * **Downstream logic:** If a disabled node is part of the only path to later actions, the workflow will skip the disabled node(s) and continue executing any active downstream nodes reachable by the current path.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Will contacts get stuck at a disabled node?**

No. HighLevel automatically skips disabled nodes and continues down any active path.

  


  


**Q: Can I disable an entire branch?**

Yes, toggle off each node in that branch. All disabled nodes will be skipped until re-enabled.

  


  


**Q: Is this the same as the “Pause Workflows on Certain Dates” feature?**

No. Pause Workflow Actions pauses individual steps inside a single workflow, while Pause Workflows on Certain Dates pauses entire published workflows for date ranges. 

  


  


**Q: What happens if I switch to the Standard Builder with disabled nodes still present?**

You’ll be prompted to delete or re-enable those nodes before the builder can load.

  


  


**Q: Do disabled nodes count toward execution limits?**

No, because they’re skipped, they do not consume executions.

  


  


**Q: Can I bulk-enable or disable nodes?**

At launch, toggling is done one node at a time. Bulk actions are not yet supported.

  


  


**Q: Will logs show skipped nodes?**

Yes. Execution logs mark disabled nodes as Skipped, providing clear traceability during testing.
