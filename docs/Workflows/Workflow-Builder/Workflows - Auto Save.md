# **What is Auto Save in the Workflows?**

  


Auto Save is a feature that continuously saves your workflow **canvas** edits in the background while you build. Your changes are written to the current **draft** so you don’t lose progress; you still control when updates go live by clicking **Publish**.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Auto Save in Workflows**

  


  * **Zero manual saves** : Canvas edits are captured automatically as you build—no Save button required.  
  


  * **Draft safety** : Changes save to draft only; nothing affects live workflows until you click **Publish**.  
  


  * **Fewer clicks** : Toggle Auto Save once and move faster without pausing to save.  
  


  * **Reliable checkpoints** : Create named milestones any time with **Save Version** so you can return to a known good state.  
  


  * **Collaboration awareness** : When multiple people or tabs edit the same workflow, the **most recent auto-save** becomes the current draft version.


* * *

## **Draft vs. Publish Behavior**

  


Auto Save writes your ongoing edits to the draft state. Publishing is still a deliberate action you take to push changes live.

Understanding draft vs. published behavior prevents accidental changes from impacting active workflows.

  


  * **Auto Save → Draft only:** Edits are preserved in the draft as you work.  
  


  * **Publish controls go-live:** Click **Publish** when your draft is ready to run.  
  


  * **Safe iteration:** You can make and store many changes without affecting currently published behavior.


* * *

## **What Auto Save Captures**

  


Knowing exactly what’s captured helps you avoid missing important changes. Auto Save will capture when you:

  


  * Add any **action** or **trigger** to the canvas  
  


  * Delete any **action** or **trigger** from the canvas  
  


  * Make changes in the **Settings** tab of a workflow  
  


  * Edit the **Workflow name**  
  


  * Change workflow status (**Draft** or **Publish**)


* * *

## **What Auto Save Doesn’t Capture (Configuration Modals)**

  


Auto Save does **not** apply inside individual action/trigger **configuration modals**. Changes inside a modal are not saved until you commit them back to the canvas.

  


  * While editing a step’s settings in a modal, click **Save** /**Apply** (or the equivalent) to commit changes back to the canvas.  
  


  * Once committed to the canvas, Auto Save will capture the update in the draft.  
  


  * **Example:** Changing the time in a **Wait** step inside its modal isn’t auto-saved until you click **Save** in the modal to update the canvas.


* * *

## **Version History & Checkpoints**

  


Each editing session automatically creates entries in **Version History**. You can also use **Save Version** any time to create a named checkpoint.

  


Version History gives you a recoverable record of progress. Named checkpoints make it easy to roll back to key milestones.

  


  * **Session entries:** Automatic, created as you edit with Auto Save enabled.  
  


  * **Save Version:** Manual, creates a named checkpoint you can easily identify later.  
  


  * **Restore:** Use Version History to review and restore an earlier state as needed.


* * *

## **Multi‑Editor & Multi‑Tab Behavior**

  


If multiple users or browser tabs edit the same workflow, the **most recent auto-save becomes the current draft version**.

Coordinating edits prevents overwriting each other’s changes and ensures everyone works from the latest draft.

  


  * Prefer a single editor at a time for critical updates.  
  


  * If collaborating, communicate timing to avoid collisions.  
  


  * If you return after being idle, refresh to make sure you’re viewing the latest draft.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does Auto Save publish my changes automatically?**

No. Auto Save updates the **draft** only. Click **Publish** to push changes live.

  


**Q: Do I still need to click Save inside step configuration modals?**

Yes. Changes made inside a step’s modal must be **Saved/Applied** to commit to the canvas; then Auto Save captures them.

  


**Q: What happens if my internet drops while I’m editing?**

When connectivity returns, your canvas can resume saving. If you’re unsure which draft is current, refresh the workflow and review **Version History**.

  


**Q: Does Auto Save work with the AI Workflow Builder?**

Yes! When you generate a workflow using AI Builder, it saves automatically. Any further edits you make using AI Builder will also be saved automatically.
