Workflows help you automate repetitive tasks so you can save time and scale your business. Once configured, workflows run automatically based on triggers and perform a sequence of actions without manual intervention.

  


You can use workflows to manage leads, automate follow-ups, send communications, and streamline operations across your business.

## **What are Workflows?**

  


A workflow is an automated sequence of actions triggered by a specific event.

  


### **Example:**  
  


  * A lead submits a form → send confirmation email + SMS  
  


  * A customer books an appointment → notify team + follow-up


  


Workflows consist of:  
  


  * **Trigger** → Starts the workflow  
  


  * **Actions** → Tasks performed after the trigger


* * *

## **Workflow Triggers**

  


Triggers define when a workflow begins.

  


### **Example:**  
  


  * Form submitted  
  


  * Appointment booked  
  


  * Payment received

* * *

## **Workflow Actions**

  


Actions are the steps that occur after a trigger fires.

  


### **Example:**  
  


  * Send email or SMS  
  


  * Create or update contact  
  


  * Assign tasks or opportunities

## **How to Create a Workflow**

  


Workflows are created in three main steps:

###   
**Step 1:**_Choose a Trigger_

  


Select the event that starts the workflow.  
  


  * Click **Add New Trigger**  
  


  * Choose from available triggers  
  


### **![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155070070512/original/-CK_Dy-9aEZxNRk_68hPdyDIKZCeqONVDg.png?1777327942)**  


### **Step 2:__**_Add Trigger Filters (Optional)_

  


Filters refine when the workflow should trigger.

  


### **Example:**  
  


  * Only trigger for incoming calls  
  
  


  * Only trigger for a specific phone number


###

###   
**Step 3:**_Add Workflow Actions_

  


Actions define what happens after the trigger.  
  


  * Click **Add Action**  
  


  * Select the action you want

## **Workflows Landing Page (Updated Experience)**

  


The Workflows landing page has been redesigned to make it easier to get started.  
  


  


You now have three clear options:  
  


  * **Build using AI** – Describe your workflow and let AI generate it  
  


  * **Browse Templates** – Choose from pre-built workflows  
  


  * **Create Workflow** – Start from scratch


  


This helps new users quickly choose the best way to begin building workflows.

  


If AI Builder is disabled in Labs, the previous landing experience will be shown instead.

## **Types of Advanced Workflows**

  


### **IF/Else Conditions**

  


Split contacts into different paths based on conditions.

* * *

## **Chaining Multiple Workflows**

  


You can connect multiple workflows together to automate full pipelines and customer journeys.

* * *

## **Webhooks (Trigger & Action)**

  


Webhooks allow HighLevel to communicate with external systems and automate workflows across platforms.

* * *

## **Troubleshooting Workflow Issues**

  1. **Test with a fresh contact:** Use a new contact that has not previously entered the workflow to rule out prior enrollment or re-entry restrictions.  
  


  2. **Review trigger filters:** Confirm the contact meets all trigger conditions and filters required to enter the workflow.  
  


  3. **Check re-entry settings:** Verify whether the workflow allows the same contact to enter more than once when repeat enrollment is expected.  
  


  4. **Compare live behavior with test mode:** If the workflow works in test mode but not with a live contact, review the live trigger event and enrollment conditions.  
  


  5. **Review execution and error logs:** Check the workflow execution history for skipped steps, failed actions, or error messages that can help identify the cause.  
  


  6. **Escalate with evidence:** If the issue continues, provide the affected contact, workflow name, approximate test time, screenshots, and relevant execution or error details when contacting support.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: What is the difference between a trigger and an action?**

A trigger starts the workflow when a specific event occurs, while actions are the steps that run after the trigger is activated.

  
**Q: Can I use multiple triggers in one workflow?**

Yes. You can add multiple triggers to a workflow, allowing contacts to enter from different sources.

  
**Q: Are workflow filters required?**

No, filters are optional. However, they are recommended to ensure workflows only run under specific conditions.

  
**Q: Can I edit a workflow after creating it?**

Yes. You can update triggers, filters, and actions at any time.

  
**Q: Will workflows run automatically once created?**

Yes, as long as the workflow is published and the trigger conditions are met.

  
**Q: What happens if a workflow is not working correctly?**

Check your trigger conditions, filters, and workflow settings. Testing with a fresh contact is also recommended.

  
**Q: Can I use AI to create workflows?**

Yes. The updated Workflows landing page allows you to describe your workflow and generate it using AI.
