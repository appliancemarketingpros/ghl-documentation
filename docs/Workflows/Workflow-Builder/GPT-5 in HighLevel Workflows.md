## **What is GPT 5 in Workflows?**

  
GPT‑5 in Workflows is HighLevel’s latest integration of OpenAI’s GPT‑5 family, enabling any workflow to generate or transform text with unprecedented accuracy and speed. By selecting the GPT action and choosing a GPT‑5 variant, you unlock longer context windows, richer reasoning, and lower latency compared to earlier models.

## **Key Benefits of GPT 5 in Workflows**

  
Intelligent automation gets real‑time, enterprise‑grade language understanding.

  


  * **Speed:** Accelerated processing for near real‑time execution, reducing wait times for customers.  
  


  * **Reliability:** Consistent, high‑quality outputs thanks to GPT‑5’s refined reasoning abilities.  
  


  * **Flexibility:** Three model tiers let you balance performance and budget without rewriting workflows.  
  


  * **Simplicity:** Native, click‑to‑configure action keeps integration and maintenance effortless.

## **GPT 5 Models, Pricing, and Token Math**

  
Choose the tier that matches your volume and performance needs—pay only for the tokens you consume.

  


Model| Best For| Max Context Window| Relative Latency*| Input Cost per 1M Tokens| Output Cost per 1M Tokens  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
GPT‑5| Long‑form reasoning, document analysis, high‑stakes copy| 256k| ◼︎◼︎◼︎◼︎ (slower)| $1.25| $10.00  
GPT‑5 Mini (default)| General email drafting, chat replies, marketing copy| 128k| ◼︎◼︎◼︎ (balanced)| $0.25| $2.00  
GPT‑5 Nano| High‑volume classification, short replies, light summarization| 64k| ◼︎◼︎ (fastest)| $0.05| $0.40  
GPT-5.1| Better Instruction following over other OpenAI models with a warmer, more conversational personality.| 128k|   
| $1.25| $10.00  
  
  


  

    
    
    **IMPORTANT** : Pricing mirrors OpenAI’s published rates and is billed via your HighLevel AI wallet. Both agency markup and client rebilling apply automatically.

  


  


### **Token Math**

  
Mastering token math lets you forecast AI costs accurately and avoid billing surprises. HighLevel bills GPT‑5 usage exactly as OpenAI does, by counting input tokens (your prompt + context) and output tokens (the model’s response). One token is roughly four characters of English text. Charges are prorated to the nearest thousandth of a million tokens (0.001 M).

  


#### **Example:-** A 400-word email (~2,000 characters ≈ 500 tokens) sent to GPT-5 Mini costs:

  


  * **Input** : 500 tokens × $0.25 / 1M = $0.000125  
  

  * **Output** : 500 tokens × $2.00 / 1M = $0.001  
  

  * **Total** : $0.001125 for that action.

## **How To Set Up GPT 5 in Workflows**

  


Proper setup ensures the right GPT‑5 model is applied, balances speed and cost, and keeps your workflows production‑ready. Here’s how to configure it in a few clicks.

  


### **_Step 1:_**_Select the GPT action_

  


Open your workflow and under 'add action' click the “+” icon where you want the AI step and search for “GPT powered by OpenAI.” Select the GPT action.

### _**Step 2:** Choose GPT‑5 Mini, GPT‑5, GPT‑5 Nano or GPT 5.1_

  


In the Model dropdown, leave the default GPT‑5 Mini or choose GPT‑5 / GPT‑5 Nano to match your use‑case.

    **Please Note:** Compose your prompt or map inbound data fields. (See [AI Prompting 101 ](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000002254-ai-prompting-101>)for best practices.) Save the step and publish the workflow. Your automation now runs with GPT‑5 intelligence.

## **Best-Practice Prompt Tips for GPT-5 Models**

  


  * **Provide Role & Format:** Begin system prompts with the model’s role and the exact output schema.  
  

  * **Use Delimiters for Long Inputs** : Wrap large documents in triple back-ticks ( ```` ) to preserve formatting.  
  

  * **Chunk When Possible:** For Nano, split multi-page content into smaller calls to keep cost ultra-low.  
  

  * **Include Examples:** Few-shot examples still improve consistency, especially with Mini or Nano.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Which GPT‑5 model is most cost‑effective for large‑volume tasks?**  
GPT‑5 Nano offers the lowest per‑token rate, making it ideal for high‑volume or background tasks where speed is less critical.

  


**Q: Can I change the model later without rebuilding the workflow?**  
Yes, edit the GPT action, select a different model, and save; no other steps need adjustment.

  


**Q: How are input and output tokens calculated?**  
Input tokens include the prompt and context; output tokens are the model’s response. Both are metered and priced separately.

  


**Q: Are there usage limits on GPT‑5 requests?**  
HighLevel enforces the same rate limits as OpenAI. Heavy usage may queue requests during peak traffic.

  


**Q: Does GPT‑5 support longer context windows than GPT‑4 Turbo?**  
Yes, GPT‑5 supports up to 256k tokens of context, allowing richer conversations and multi‑step reasoning.
