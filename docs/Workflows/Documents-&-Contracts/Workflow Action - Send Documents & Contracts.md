If your organization has multiple salespeople but only one person responsible for sending out final contracts, you can now streamline the process using the **Send Documents & Contracts** action in Workflows.

  


Dynamic assignment ensures the correct internal user signs templates that include **Sender** fields, eliminating manual edits per run. This is ideal for teams where the workflow sender or template owner varies by record or pipeline.

  


By choosing to create contracts as _drafts_ rather than sending them directly, you can ensure that only the designated contract sender reviews and sends contracts.

## **Why Use the “Create as Draft” Feature?**

  * **Centralized Review:** Only one person (or team) is responsible for reviewing and sending contracts, so you avoid confusion or accidental sends even after automated creation using templates.  
  


  * **Quality Control:** Based on a Sales staff action or end user's action such as completing a form or any other action, it would still trigger the workflow to prepare the document, but the final send occurs after a designated check from the Documents & Contracts section.

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### 1\. Create or Edit Your Workflow

  1. In your account, go to **Workflows** and select **New Workflow** or edit an existing one.

  2. In the workflow builder, add a **Trigger**. Common triggers might include:

     * A new deal stage being reached.

     * A specific form being completed.

     * Opportunity status being updated.


### 2\. Add the “Send Documents & Contracts” Action

  1. Click on **Add New Action**.

  2. Select **Send Documents & Contracts** from the list of available actions.

### 3\. Configure the Action

  1. **Action Name:** Give the action a meaningful name (e.g., “Draft Contract Creation”).  
  


  2. **From User:** Choose the user who will appear as the sender on the draft contract.  
  


  3. **Template:** Select the contract template you want to send to your contacts.  
  


  4. **Sending Mode:** Select **Create as Draft**. This ensures the document is generated but not immediately sent.


> **Tip:** If you have multiple salespeople creating deals, you can build your workflow to auto-generate draft contracts for each relevant contact or opportunity.

### 4\. Save and Publish Your Workflow

  * After configuring the details, click **Save Action**.  
  


  * Once you’re satisfied with the entire workflow, click **Publish**. Any contacts who enter this workflow will now trigger a draft contract to be created automatically.


  


  

    
    
    **Limitations & Workarounds**  
      
    Workflows only evaluate the document/contract status **at the moment the contact enters the workflow**. If a contact enters on a trigger like “Document Sent”, and you later add a condition for “Status is Completed”, that branch logic **will**not update** even if the document gets completed afterward.**  
      
    This behavior is **not dynamic** — status updates outside the workflow are not tracked or re-evaluated.  
      
    If you need real-time responses based on document status, Create a **second workflow** triggered by events like **Document Signed** or **Document Completed**. Also, Route contacts in that second workflow using updated statuses.

## **Assign Sender Fields Dynamically (From User vs Template Owner)**

  


Use this setting to auto-assign template fields marked **To be signed by → Sender** at send time—no manual edits per run.

  


**How it works**

If the selected template contains **Sender** fields, the action detects them and assigns those fields to your choice below.

This applies to all **Sender** fields in the template for that send.

  


**Options**

**From User:** assigns Sender fields to the workflow’s **From user** (the user sending the document).  
  


**Template Owner** : assigns Sender fields to the **user who last updated the template**.

  


**Steps**

  


1\. Select the **From user** at the top of the action.

2\. Choose a Template that uses **To be signed by → Sender** on its fillable field(s).

  


3\. Set **Assign Sender Fields To** to **From User** or **Template Owner**.

4\. Choose **Sending Mode** and **Channel** (**Email** or **Direct**), then **Save**.

## **Sending Out Draft Contracts**

  


After your workflow has created contracts in a draft state, the final sending responsibility lies with the designated person or team. Here’s how to send them:

  1. **Navigate to Documents & Contracts:** In your account, go to the **Documents** or **Contracts** section.  
  


  2. **Locate Drafts:** You will see all drafted contracts.  
  


  3. **Review and Edit (If Needed):** Make any final edits or personalizations to the document.  
  


  4. **Send the Contract:** When you are ready, click **Send**. The contract will then be delivered to the contact, and you can track its status from there.

## Frequently Asked Questions

  1. **Can multiple people review draft contracts before sending?**  
Yes. If you have a team approach to reviewing, any users with the necessary permissions can open and review the draft before it’s sent.  
  


  2. **Can I automate sending directly if I don’t need a review step?**  
Absolutely. Under **Sending Mode** , choose “Send Directly” if you want the contract automatically sent without needing to go through the draft stage.  
  


  3. **Where can I see the status of my contracts?**  
Go to **Payments >** **Documents** & **Contracts** . Each contract will show whether it is in Draft, Sent, or Completed status.
