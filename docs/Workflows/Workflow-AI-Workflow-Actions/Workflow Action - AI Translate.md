This article will guide you through using the**AI****Translate** action in your workflows. You'll learn how to automatically translate text from a source language to a target language, making it easier to personalize communication for a global audience.

  


  


# **What is the "AI Translate" Workflow Action?**

#   


"AI Translate" action is a powerful action within the workflow builder that allows you to translate any given text from one language to another. By integrating this action, you can automate multilingual communications. For instance, you can take an incoming message in one language, translate it, and then use that translated text in a subsequent action, like an email, SMS, or internal notification. This ensures contacts receive messages in their preferred language, enhancing customer experience.

### **Step 1: Add the "Translate Content" Action**

#### **1\. Action name:** Give your action a descriptive name (e.g., "Translate Welcome Email to Spanish")

Input the source language of the text you want to translate. This is the language your original text is written in. (e.g., "English")

  * **Static Value:** Type the text directly into the field.

# **Example Use Case**

  


### **Example: Translating a Welcome Message**

Imagine a new contact signs up through a form and specifies "French" as their preferred language. The workflow can use this information to send them a welcome email in their chosen language.

  * **Trigger** : **Contact Created**

  * **Action** : **Translate Content**

    * **Action Name** : Translate Welcome to French 

    * **From Language** : English

    * **To Language** : French

    * **Input Text** : `Hello, thank you for signing up!`

  * **Action** : **Send Email**

    * **Email Body** : Insert the output from the translation action: 

{{workflow_ai_translate_content.2.response}}


  


  


This workflow ensures the new French-speaking contact automatically receives a personalized and correctly translated welcome message.
