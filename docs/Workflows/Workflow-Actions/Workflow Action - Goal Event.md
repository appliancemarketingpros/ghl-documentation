The **Goal Event Workflow Action** allows you to track specific milestones or behavioral actions that your contacts take — such as clicking a link, submitting a form, confirming an appointment, or making a payment. When a contact meets your defined goal, the system can automatically adjust their path in the workflow, making your automations more intelligent and responsive.

  


By using Goal Events, you can streamline complex workflows, eliminate redundant triggers, and enhance customer journey personalization within HighLevel.

## **What is the Goal Event Workflow Action?**

  


Goal Events enable you to set specific objectives within your workflow that automatically guide contacts toward desired outcomes. When a contact meets the goal condition (for example, clicking a link or submitting a form), the system instantly moves them to the defined goal step, regardless of where they were in the workflow.

  


  


Goal Events serve as dynamic checkpoints in your automation. Instead of waiting for a contact to move through every step, the workflow intelligently detects when key engagement actions occur and reacts accordingly — saving time and improving accuracy in lead handling and engagement.

## **Key Benefits of Goal Events**

  


Goal Events enhance workflow efficiency by allowing automations to respond dynamically to real-time contact actions. This ensures each contact receives contextually relevant communication and experiences a smooth, personalized journey.

  


  * **Automation Efficiency:** Automatically skip steps or end workflows when a goal is achieved.


  


  * **Improved Engagement:** React instantly when a contact clicks, opens, or performs a desired action.


  


  * **Simplified Logic:** Replace multiple triggers and “If/Else” branches with a single, smart event.


  


  * **Enhanced Tracking:** Monitor email events, link clicks, tags, appointments, payments, and more.


  


  * **Customizable Actions:** Define exactly what happens when the goal is met—or not met.

## **Supported Goal Event Types**

  


  


Each goal type reflects a specific contact behavior or milestone. Selecting the correct goal ensures your workflow reacts to meaningful actions and aligns automation with your business processes.

###   


### **Form Submitted**

  


Allows workflows to react to one or more form submissions.

  


**Highlights:**

  * Goal achieved when a contact submits any selected form.


  


**Example Use Case:**

An agency wants to send follow-ups when a user fills out any lead form. The workflow uses “Wait until Form Submitted” with selected forms to centralize form responses.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q:****Can one email event meet multiple Goal Events?**

Yes, a single event (like opening an email) can trigger multiple goals if the workflows are configured that way.

  


**Q:****Will the Goal Event trigger outside business hours?**

Yes. The system monitors events continuously, so contacts meeting the goal will trigger the event immediately.

  


**Q:****Can a contact meet the same goal event multiple times?**

No, once a contact meets a specific Goal Event, they won’t be evaluated for it again within that workflow.

  


**Q:****What if an appointment is rescheduled after meeting a Goal Event?**

The workflow only reacts to the initial event. Later changes do not reverse progress.

  


**Q:****Can I use multiple Goal Events in one workflow?**

Only one Goal Event action can be added per workflow. You may configure multiple criteria inside that one Goal Event, but you cannot add more than one Goal Event action in the same workflow.

  


**Q:****Can I select multiple forms, products, or outbound communications in the goal configuration?**

Yes, you can select multiple forms, products, or outbound communications in the goal configuration. They are evaluated using **OR** logic, meaning the goal will be achieved if **any one** of the selected items matches.
