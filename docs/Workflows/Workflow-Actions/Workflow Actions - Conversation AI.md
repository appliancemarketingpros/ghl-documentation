# **What is the Conversation AI Workflow Action?**

  


The Conversation AI Workflow Action sends a single AI-generated message to a contact, waits for a reply, and routes the workflow based on the contact’s response. It uses your bot’s prompt settings and training to craft the reply and supports branching for different outcomes.
