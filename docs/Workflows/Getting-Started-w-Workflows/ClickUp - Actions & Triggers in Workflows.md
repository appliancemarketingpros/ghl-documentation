# **What is ClickUp Actions & Triggers in Workflows?**

  


ClickUp actions and triggers link HighLevel automation to ClickUp’s task and document platform. Triggers listen for events in ClickUp (like a new task or status change) and can start HighLevel workflows. Actions push data from HighLevel into ClickUp (like creating a task, space, or document). This two‑way connection reduces manual work and keeps client projects updated in real time.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of ClickUp Actions & Triggers**

  


Understanding outcomes helps you decide where to apply the integration first. The benefits below focus on typical agency and service workflows where project delivery must mirror CRM stages.

  


  * **No double entry:** Client and project details flow automatically between HighLevel and ClickUp, cutting manual updates.  
  


  * **Faster onboarding:** Spaces, folders, lists, and tasks spin up the moment a deal hits a key stage.  
  


  * **AI to docs:** Generate content with HighLevel’s AI steps and save it straight to ClickUp Docs for review.  
  


  * **Cleaner handoffs:** Comments and status updates live where your team executes work, reducing miscommunication.  
  


  * **Fewer tools to manage:** Replace many webhook/Zap automations with native, auditable workflow steps.  
  


  * **Cost control (premium):** Premium executions are usage‑based and can be rebilled to clients when enabled.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Permissions**

  


A few account‑level settings influence whether you can add ClickUp steps and how you’ll be billed. Confirm these before building.

  


  * HighLevel access to **Workflows** and **Integrations** at the sub‑account where the automation will run.  
  


  * A ClickUp user with permission to create/update items in the target workspace (actions respect ClickUp permissions).  
  


  * **Premium Features for Workflows** may need to be enabled by the Agency to run premium actions/triggers and to optionally rebill usage to clients.


* * *

## **Connecting Your ClickUp Account**

  


Authorization uses ClickUp’s official OAuth so events can be received via webhooks and actions can read/write with your permissions.

  


  1. In HighLevel, open **Automation → Workflows** and add any **ClickUp** action or trigger.  
→ If not connected, click **Connect Now** and sign in to ClickUp to approve access.  
→ If already connected, fields load instantly in the step.

## **How To Setup ClickUp Actions & Triggers**

  


Use this generic setup to connect accounts, pick the correct direction (trigger vs. action), map fields safely, and validate everything before you publish. Adapt these steps to any pipeline stage or project template.  
  


  1. **Open a workflow**  
  
Go to **Automation → Workflows** and click **\+ New Workflow** (or open an existing one).  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056563322/original/oBVlC-MdURl-P7G_AeqopEAluiVDfg5qkQ.png?1761129355)  
  


  2. **Connect ClickUp**  
  
Add any **ClickUp** step in a workflow and click **Connect Now** , or go to **Settings → Integrations → ClickUp → Connect** to authorize via OAuth.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056563354/original/6Y2pFx9ZsNJ_09OJdf-zGUM1YNSl6j9bGg.png?1761129378)  
  


  3. **Choose the direction**  
  
**ClickUp → HighLevel (Triggers):** Start a HighLevel workflow when something happens in ClickUp by adding a **ClickUp** trigger (e.g., _New Task_ , _Task Changes_)  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155056563404/original/9AQMRWvJwFGSWV8i1JKIC62ohsgfdbYYoA.png?1761129398)  
  


  4. **HighLevel → ClickUp (Actions):** Perform work in ClickUp from a HighLevel workflow.  
  
Add a **ClickUp** action (e.g., _Create Task_ , _Create List_ , _Create New Document_). Select the target **Workspace/List** (as applicable) and **map fields** from HighLevel (contact, opportunity, or form values).

  5. **Order, conditions, and safety**

     * Use **If/Else** filters to segment by pipeline stage, service type, or tag.

     * Insert **Wait** steps where ClickUp objects must exist before the next action (e.g., wait after _Create List_ before creating tasks).

     * For bulk creation, space actions to avoid rate‑limit bursts.  
  


  6. **Test & validate**

     * Trigger path: create a small test event in the scoped ClickUp area.

     * Action path: run the workflow on a test record.

     * Review **Run Logs / Enrollment History** for inputs, outputs, and returned IDs; fix mapping/permissions issues.  
  


  7. **Publish & monitor**

     * Click **Publish** in the workflow.

## **Common Use Cases**

  


### ** _Use Case 1: Create ClickUp Tasks from HighLevel Form Submissions_**

  


**Goal:** Convert HighLevel form submissions into actionable ClickUp tasks.  
  
**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Form Submitted

  * **Filter:** Form Name = “Client Onboarding Form”

  * **Actions:** Create Task (ClickUp), Add Task Comment (ClickUp)  
  


**Example:**  
A client submits the onboarding form with their requirement details → A task is created in the “Client Setup” list in ClickUp → A comment is added with the client’s expectations.

###   


  


### **_Use Case 2: Auto-Generate AI-Powered Proposal Documents_**

  


**Goal:** Automatically generate personalized proposals, briefs, or summaries when an opportunity changes stage, using AI to draft content and ClickUp to store the document.

  


**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Opportunity Status Changed

  * **Filter:** Stage = “Proposal request” (or any relevant pipeline stage)

  * **Actions:**

    1. **GPT powered by OpenAI** → Generate proposal content (e.g., client-specific summary, deliverables, pricing outline).

    2. **Create New Document (ClickUp)** → Save the AI-generated proposal in ClickUp under the “Sales Docs” folder.  
  


**Example:**  
A deal advances to the “Proposal Sent” stage → GPT generates a tailored proposal titled _“Proposal for {{contact.name}}”_ with scope, deliverables, and pricing → A new ClickUp document is automatically created and shared with the sales team for review.

###   


  


### **_Use Case 3: Auto-Build Project Spaces Based on Opportunity Type_**

  


**Goal:** Automatically set up structured project workspaces in ClickUp whenever a deal moves to a new stage, with tasks and notifications tailored to the service type (Landing Page, SEO, or Google Ads).

  


**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Pipeline Stage Changed

  * **Action:** Create Space in ClickUp (named after the client/opportunity)

  * **Condition Branching:**

    * **Landing Page Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “Landing Page”

      * Create List: _Landing Page Project_

      * Create Task: “Design Landing Page”

      * Internal Notification to assigned team

    * **SEO Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “SEO”

      * Create List: _SEO Setup_

      * Create Task: “Keyword Research & Site Audit”

      * Internal Notification to SEO team

    * **Google Ads Branch** → If Opportunity Name = “Google_Ads”

      * Create List: _Google Ads Campaign_

      * Create Task: “Campaign Setup & Tracking”

      * Internal Notification to Ads team

    * **None Branch** → Ends workflow if conditions are not met  
  


**Example:**  
A deal moves to the “Contract Signed” stage. If the opportunity is for SEO, a new ClickUp space named _“[Client Name] - SEO Project”_ is created. Inside it, an _SEO Setup_ list is generated with a first task: _Keyword Research & Site Audit_. An internal notification is sent to the SEO manager, ensuring immediate project kickoff.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Which ClickUp plan do I need?**  
The integration works on free and paid plans; certain capabilities (like time tracking or some custom‑field features) may require a paid ClickUp plan.  
  


**Q: How many ClickUp workspaces can I connect?**  
Connect the ClickUp workspace relevant to the sub‑account; actions/permissions follow that workspace’s authorization.  
  


**Q: Can I use dynamic due dates?**  
Yes. Use relative math like **+7 days** in the Due Date input.  
  


**Q: Where do I find errors?**  
Check **Execution Logs & Enrollment History** for each run’s inputs/outputs and any error messages.

  


**Q: Is this integration available to all HighLevel users?  
** Yes, it’s available to all accounts with access to workflows and integrations.  
  


**Q: How many workflows can I build with ClickUp?  
** There no workflow limits from Highlevel and ClickUp integration itself doesn’t impose limits beyond ClickUp’s API rate caps.  
  


**Q: Are these actions and triggers paid?  
** Yes. These are premium actions and will be billed at the standard rates. If you’re on a Pro plan , usage will be billed at the plan’s default rates.

  


**How do I associate a workflow with a contact when using triggers?**

Triggers are contactless by default, meaning they do not automatically associate the workflow with a specific contact.

If you need to link the workflow to a contact, you can use the **Find Contact** action within the workflow. Pass the **email address from the trigger response** (if an email is available) into the Find Contact action to locate and associate the correct contact. Or using create contact if a new contact has to be created.
