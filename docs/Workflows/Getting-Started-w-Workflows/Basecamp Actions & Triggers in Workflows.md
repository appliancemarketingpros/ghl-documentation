# **What is the Basecamp Integration in Workflows?**

HighLevel’s native Basecamp integration lets you react to Basecamp activity instantly and perform Basecamp tasks directly from a workflow. Use Basecamp triggers (like **New To‑do** or **New Message Posted**) to enroll records the moment activity happens, and add Basecamp actions (like **Create Project** , **Create/Update To‑do** , **Create Message** , **Create Document**) to streamline onboarding, task tracking, and client delivery.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Basecamp Integration**

  


  * **Faster handoffs:** Automatically create projects, to‑do lists, and tasks when deals move to delivery.  
  


  * **Instant triggers:** Webhook‑based triggers fire immediately—no polling delays.  
  


  * **Fewer duplicates:** “Find” actions (Project/List/To‑do/Person/Document) let you search first, then create only when needed.  
  


  * **Flexible plans:** Works with Basecamp’s free and paid plans (feature availability depends on your Basecamp plan).  
  


  * **Predictable costs:** Basecamp triggers/actions are premium and billed per execution under Workflow Pro tiers; agencies can optionally rebill.

## **Triggers & Actions**

  


**Triggers (Basecamp → HighLevel)**  
These events enroll records into a workflow the moment they occur in Basecamp.

New Activity| New activity occurs in a Basecamp project (project‑level event).  
New Message Posted| A new message is posted in a project.  
New To‑do List| A new to‑do list is created.  
  
  


**Actions (HighLevel → Basecamp)**  
Run these steps in workflows to create, update, or look up items inside Basecamp.

## **How To Set Up the Basecamp Integration**

  


**Connect Basecamp (two paths)**  
  


  1. **From a Trigger/Action step**


  * In Workflows → open or create a workflow.

  * Click **\+ Add Trigger** (or **\+ Add Action**) and search **Basecamp**.

  * Choose a Basecamp trigger or action, then click **Connect Now**.

  * Sign in to Basecamp and authorize HighLevel.

  2. **From Settings → Integrations**


  * Go to **Settings → Integrations** , locate **Basecamp** , and complete the OAuth connection.

  * **Note:** Connections are **per sub‑account (location)**. Install/bulk install does not auto‑connect every location—authorize in each sub‑account that needs Basecamp.

## **Build your first flow**

  


  1. From the desired sub‑account, go to **Automations → Workflows** and click **Create Workflow** (or open an existing one).  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057547881/original/D3_V9Kb0d_yu1u3zNKHrPOONI0QlsZmLkA.png?1762265810)  
  


  2. Add a Basecamp **Trigger** (e.g., _New To‑do_) and select the target project or scope (as required).  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057547912/original/zmOYumtJrnMy6nY80amqxGDtmUCiTS6OjQ.png?1762265831)

  3. Add Basecamp **Actions** (e.g., _Find Project_ → _If Not Found_ → _Create Project_ , then _Create To‑do List_ → _Create To‑do_).  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057547984/original/y85Xxu12til6jE1PM0hm2QdHZc_DL209oA.png?1762265880)

  4. Add internal follow‑ups (e.g., **Notify User** , **Send Email** , **Update Opportunity**).  
  


  5. **Publish** and perform a one‑time event (e.g., create a to‑do in Basecamp) to verify entries appear in **Execution Logs**.

## **Use Cases**

  


### ** _Use Case 1: Create To‑do + Project Document from a HighLevel Form_**

  * **Goal:** Turn a submitted intake form into actionable Basecamp work and documentation.

  * **Workflow Setup:**

    * Trigger: **Form Submitted**

    * Filter: Form Name = “Project Intake Form”
    * Actions: **Create To‑do** (Basecamp), **Create Document** (Basecamp), **Notify User**

  * **Example:** A client submits the “Project Intake” form. A task appears in Basecamp (“Create workspace for Client X”), a document is created with the form answers, and your team is notified to kick off.

### **_Use Case 2: AI Kickoff Brief on “Closed Won”_**

  * **Goal:** Generate a project summary via AI, store it in Basecamp, and alert the team.

  * **Workflow Setup:**

    * Trigger: **Opportunity Stage Changed** (Stage = Closed Won)

    * Filter: Opportunity Stage = “Closed Won”
    * Actions: **GPT (OpenAI)** → **Create Document** (Basecamp) → **Notify User**

  * **Example:** When the deal closes, AI drafts a kickoff brief using opportunity details. The brief is saved as a Basecamp document and the onboarding team is notified.

### **_Use Case 3: Create To‑do List + Task from a HighLevel Form_**

  * **Goal:** Stand up a fresh list with a first task whenever a request form is submitted.

  * **Workflow Setup:**

    * Trigger: **Form Submitted**

    * Filter: None
    * Actions: **Create To‑do List** (Basecamp) → **Condition** → **Create To‑do** (Basecamp)

  * **Example:** On submission, a new list “Website Redesign – Client ABC” is created. If successful, a task “Assign designer & schedule kickoff” is added so work can begin immediately.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I need a paid Basecamp plan?**  
The integration works with Basecamp’s free and paid plans. Advanced Basecamp features still follow your Basecamp subscription limits.

  


**Q: Can I sync data both ways between Basecamp and HighLevel?  
** The integration currently supports one-way sync. You can trigger workflows when events happen in Basecamp or perform actions in Basecamp from HighLevel. For full bi-directional syncing, use middleware platforms like Make or Zapier.

  


**Q: Are the Basecamp steps premium‑billed in HighLevel?**  
Yes. Basecamp triggers and actions are premium and billed per execution at your account’s standard rate. Agencies can optionally rebill sub‑accounts.

  


**Q: Can I create a project from a template?**  
Yes. **Create Project** supports creating from a template when available in your Basecamp account.

  


**Q: Where do I troubleshoot failures?**  
Open **Execution Logs** to review the specific step error (e.g., invalid ID, missing permission). If authorization expired, reconnect Basecamp under **Settings → Integrations** and re‑run a test.

  


**Q: Can I connect multiple Basecamp accounts?**  
Yes. Authenticate the appropriate Basecamp account per sub‑account and select the desired connection in each action/trigger step. Changing the selected account may reload or reset account-dependent fields.
