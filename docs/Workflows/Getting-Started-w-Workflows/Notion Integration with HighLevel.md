## **What is Notion Integration with HighLevel?**

  


The Notion integration in HighLevel enables seamless automation between your CRM workflows and Notion’s powerful workspace platform. Whether you’re managing internal documentation, client portals, or dynamic project wikis, this integration allows you to trigger workflows or automate Notion actions — reducing manual effort and enhancing visibility across your tools.

  


**Why It Matters:**

  


With this integration, agencies, marketers, and small businesses can:

  


  * Automatically sync customer data into Notion databases  
  


  * Create tasks, notes, or updates based on CRM events  
  


  * Build live, CRM-powered knowledge bases and content repositories


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Notion Integration**

  


  * Replace Zapier/n8n stacks with one native connection, cutting subscription costs.  
  

  * Sync onboarding forms, appointment results, or pipeline changes directly into structured Notion databases.  
  

  * Auto-generate project wikis, proposals, or SOP pages the moment deals advance.  
  

  * Two-way communication: trigger workflows from Notion edits or drive Notion updates from HighLevel actions.  
  

  * Five-minute polling keeps Notion-originated triggers responsive without overloading your workspace.

## **Triggers: Triggers (Notion → HighLevel)**

  


These are events in Notion that can initiate workflows in HighLevel:

  


**Trigger Name**| **Description**  
---|---  
New Database Item| Fires when a new item is added to a Notion database  
Updated Database Item| Fires when an existing item is modified  
Updated Page| Fires when a Notion page is updated  
  
  


  

    
    
    **Note:** All triggers rely on polling. HighLevel checks Notion every ~5 minutes for changes and processes new data accordingly.

## **Actions (HighLevel → Notion)**

  


These are actions HighLevel can execute in Notion through workflows:

  


**Action Name**| **Description**  
---|---  
Archive Database Item| Archives a selected database item in Notion  
Create Database Item| Adds a new item to a chosen database

## **How Notion Triggers Work**

  


Notion triggers are powered by polling. Every 5 minutes, HighLevel sends a request to Notion to check for any changes. If it detects a qualifying event (e.g., new database item or an updated page), it triggers your workflow.

  


**Setup Instructions:**

  


  1. Choose a trigger (e.g., New Database Item).  
  

  2. Name your trigger and click **Test Trigger**.  
  


  3. HighLevel will retrieve metadata from Notion to enable dynamic field mapping in downstream actions.

## **Use Case 1: Create Notion Docs from Form Submissions**

  


**Goal:** Capture form submissions in Notion for project tracking or onboarding.

  


**Workflow Setup:**

  


  * **Trigger:** Form Submitted  
  


  * **Filter:** Form Name = “Onboarding Form”  
  


  * **Actions:**

**Example:** A client submits the onboarding form → A new entry is created in the “Client Onboarding DB” in Notion → A welcome message is added as a comment.
