# **What is the Airtable Integration in Workflows?**

  


HighLevel’s native Airtable integration lets you react to Airtable record changes and perform Airtable tasks directly from a workflow. Use Airtable triggers to enroll runs when rows are created or updated, and add Airtable actions (Find/Create/Update/Delete) to keep CRM and boards in sync.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Airtable Integration**

  


These benefits highlight how HighLevel and Airtable work together to route data faster, reduce manual tasks, and centralize operations in one automation hub.  
  


  * **Effortless data consistency:** keep project trackers and CRM data aligned as records change.  
  


  * **Native automation:** replace external connectors by running Airtable steps directly in HighLevel.  
  


  * **Predictable billing:** Airtable steps are premium executions and can be rebilled to sub‑accounts.  
  


  * **Fast trigger detection:** polling checks Airtable about every 5 minutes for new or updated records.  
  


  * **Works on Airtable’s free plan:** get started without upgrading Airtable (Airtable’s own limits still apply).


* * *

## **Triggers & Actions**

  


This overview consolidates the Airtable trigger and actions in one place so you can quickly compare capabilities and what each step returns for downstream mapping.  
  


Type| Name| Description  
---|---|---  
Trigger| New Record| Fires when a new row is added to the selected Airtable table. Detected via polling (~5 minutes).  
Trigger| Updated Record| Fires when an existing row changes in the selected table. Detected via polling (~5 minutes).  
Action| Find Record| Looks up a record by Record ID or field criteria; returns values as **Custom Values** for downstream steps.  
Action| Create Record| Creates a new row in the selected table with fields you map from the workflow.  
Action| Update Record| Updates one or more fields in an identified row (e.g., via Record ID or a prior Find result).  
Action| Delete Record| Permanently removes a row from the selected table.

## **How To Set Up the Airtable Integration**

  


A clean connection and correct mapping ensure reliable enrollments and actions. Use the options below to connect quickly and verify with a live test.

  


### **Connect Airtable (two paths)**

  


  1. **From a Trigger/Action step**

     * In **Automations → Workflows** , click **\+ Add Trigger** and search **Airtable** or click **\+ Add Action** and search **Airtable**.

     * Choose **New Record** /**Updated Record** (trigger) or an Airtable action, then click **Connect Now**.

  2. Add **New Record** or **Updated Record** (Airtable) and select the **Base** and **Table**. Click **Test Trigger** to pull a sample.

  3. Add Airtable Actions (e.g.,**Find Record** , then **Update Record** or **Create Record**). Map email/phone/IDs from the trigger sample.

  4. Add follow‑ups (e.g.,**Send Email** , **Notify User** , **Create Opportunity**), then **Publish** and test once to verify entries in **Execution Logs**.

## **Use Cases**

  


These real-world patterns show how to pair Airtable steps with workflow logic to notify teams, keep data synchronized across systems, and generate tasks with AI.

  


### **_Use Case 1: Create Tasks and Notify Team from Airtable Records_**

**Goal:** Notify teams when a new Airtable record is created or updated.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Airtable → **New Record** _(use_** _Updated Record_** _if you prefer to notify on changes)_

  * **Actions:**

    * **Find Record (Airtable)**

    * **Internal Notification → Email**


**Example:**  
A new client project is added in Airtable → the HighLevel workflow finds the record → an internal email is sent to the project manager saying:  
“New Airtable record created. Project ID: {{record.id}}. Please review the details.”

### ** _Use Case 2: Conditional Updates and Notifications from Airtable_**

**Goal:** Keep Airtable in sync with contacts or leads created in HighLevel and external tools.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Triggers:**

    * **Contact Changed** _(with Tag = "New")_

    * **Contact Created** _(Type = Lead)_

    * **Facebook Lead Form Submitted** _(Form = "Form 1")_

  * **Actions:**

    * **Find Record (Airtable)**

    * **If found → Update Record**

    * **If not found → Create Record**


**Example:**  
A Facebook lead form is submitted → HighLevel checks if the lead exists in Airtable → if found, the record is updated with the latest phone/email → if not found, a new Airtable record is created.

### **_Use Case 3: Automate Content Production from Airtable Briefs_**

**Goal:** Generate content and create downstream tasks based on new briefs added to Airtable.

**Workflow Setup:**

  * **Trigger:** Airtable → **New Record** (Table: “Content Briefs”)

  * **Actions:**

    * **Find Record (Airtable)**

    * **Generate Content with AI (workflows)**

    * **Create Task (ClickUp)**

    * **Send Internal Notification (workflows)**

    * **Send Email (workflows)**


**Example:** When a new brief is added, the workflow generates draft copy, creates a ClickUp task populated with the content, and alerts your team and the client.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I need a paid Airtable plan?**  
The integration works with free and paid Airtable accounts. Airtable’s own plan limits (e.g., row caps, attachment storage) still apply.  
  


**Q: Is this integration available to all users?**  
Yes, it’s available to all accounts that have access to workflows and integrations in HighLevel.  
  


**Q: Are Airtable steps premium‑billed in HighLevel?**  
Yes. The Airtable trigger and actions are premium and billed per execution at your account’s standard rate. Agencies can optionally rebill sub‑accounts.  
  


**Q: Where do new or updated rows live?**  
All actions read/write in the Base and Table you select for that step, using the connected Airtable account.  
  


**Q: How do I troubleshoot failures?**  
Check **Execution Logs** for specific step errors (e.g., invalid table/field, missing permissions). If authorization expired, reconnect Airtable and re‑run a test.
