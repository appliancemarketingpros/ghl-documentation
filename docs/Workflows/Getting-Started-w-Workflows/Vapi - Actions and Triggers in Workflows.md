## **What is VAPI in Workflows?**

VAPI allows HighLevel workflows to initiate and manage AI-powered voice and chat interactions.

There are two directions of automation:

### **VAPI → HighLevel (Triggers)**

Start a HighLevel workflow when an event occurs in VAPI (e.g., a new call is created).

### **HighLevel → VAPI (Actions)**

Trigger AI calls, chats, or file uploads inside VAPI when CRM events occur (e.g., a new lead submits a form).

This enables agencies and businesses to automate lead qualification, appointment reminders, onboarding assistance, and outbound campaigns using AI voice automation.

* * *

## **Key Benefits**

  * **Instant AI Lead Qualification** – Automatically call leads after form submission.

  * **CRM + AI Sync** – Update opportunities based on AI outcomes.

  * **Automated Appointment Confirmation** – Reduce no-shows with reminder calls.

  * **Knowledge-Powered Assistants** – Upload documents to enhance AI responses.

  * **Reduced Manual Work** – Eliminate external webhook or Zapier setups.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Permissions**

Before using VAPI in workflows:

  * Access to **Automation → Workflows**

  * A connected and active VAPI account

  * Premium Workflow features enabled


* * *

## **Available Triggers (VAPI → HighLevel)**

Trigger| Description  
---|---  
**New Assistant**|  Fires when a new AI assistant is created in VAPI  
**New Call**|  Fires when a new call is initiated in VAPI  
**New File**|  Fires when a knowledge file is uploaded to VAPI  
  
Use filters to limit workflow enrollments if needed. These triggers work on polling every 5 minutes.

* * *

## **Available Actions (HighLevel → VAPI)**

Action| Description  
---|---  
**Create a Call**|  Initiate an AI-powered voice call  
**Create Chat**|  Start a new AI chat session  
**Upload File**|  Upload a knowledge file to power AI assistants  
**Delete Call Data**|  Remove stored call data  
**Delete Chat Data**|  Remove chat session data  
**Delete File**|  Remove a knowledge file  
**Update Call Name**|  Modify call metadata  
**Find Call**|  Retrieve call details by ID  
  
* * *

## **Upload File – Supported File Types**

Only **one file can be uploaded per Upload File action step**.

If multiple files are required, add multiple Upload File steps in sequence.

### Supported File Formats

  * Markdown (.md)

  * PDF (.pdf)

  * Text files (.txt, .log)

  * CSV / TSV (.csv, .tsv)

  * HTML / CSS / JS / TS (.html, .css, .js, .ts)

  * XML (.xml)

  * JSON (.json)

  * YAML (.yaml, .yml)

  * Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx)


These files are typically used as knowledge sources for AI assistants.

* * *

## **Call Concurrency & Rate Limits**

### Default Concurrency

Every VAPI account includes **10 concurrent call slots by default**.

This means:

  * Only 10 calls can run simultaneously.

  * Additional calls are automatically queued and retried as slots become available.


For example:  
If 25 calls are triggered at the same time:

  * 10 calls start immediately.

  * 15 calls wait in queue until a slot frees up.


* * *

### Increasing Concurrency

You can increase concurrency via:

**VAPI Dashboard → Settings → Billing → Reserved Concurrency**

Additional billing may apply depending on your subscription.

* * *

### API Rate Limits

In addition to concurrency limits, API rate limits may apply depending on your VAPI subscription tier.

Best practices for high-volume campaigns:

  * Avoid triggering hundreds of calls simultaneously.

  * Use Wait steps in workflows.

  * Stagger outbound automation.

  * Monitor Execution Logs for API errors.


* * *

## **Supported Phone Numbers**

Currently, only phone numbers purchased directly inside VAPI are supported.

The following are not supported:

  * Custom Twilio numbers (Coming soon)

  * HighLevel phone numbers (Coming soon)

  * Imported external numbers (Coming soon)


If you attempt to initiate a call using an unsupported number, the call will fail.

* * *

## **How To Set Up VAPI in a Workflow**

  1. Go to **Automation → Workflows**

  2. Create or open an existing workflow

  3. Choose a trigger (e.g., Form Submitted, Appointment Created, Pipeline Stage Changed)

  4. Add a VAPI action (e.g., Create a Call)

  5. Map dynamic fields using merge values such as:

     * {{contact.first_name}}

     * {{contact.phone}}

     * {{opportunity.name}}

     * {{custom_values}}

  6. Add conditions or Wait steps if needed

  7. Test in draft mode

  8. Click **Publish**


* * *

## Common Use Cases

**1\. Instant AI Lead Qualification**  
Trigger: Form Submitted → Action: Create Call  
If AI result = Qualified → Move to Sales Stage  
If Unqualified → Add to Nurture Campaign

**2\. AI Appointment Reminder**  
Trigger: Appointment Created → Wait (before appointment) → Create Call  
If no answer → Send SMS reminder

**3\. AI Onboarding Assistant**  
Trigger: Deal Closed Won → Upload File (Onboarding PDF) → Create Chat → Internal Notification

**4\. Automated Data Cleanup**  
Trigger: Deal Closed Lost → Find Call → Delete Call Data → Delete Chat Data

* * *

### **Where to View Call Details**

HighLevel confirms call initiation.

For detailed call-level intelligence, go to the **VAPI Dashboard**.

The VAPI dashboard includes:

  * Call transcript

  * Call duration

  * Call latency

  * AI interaction logs

  * Recording (if enabled)

  * Call outcome and status

  * Assistant behavior and analytics


All detailed call data is stored inside VAPI.
