# **What is the LinkedIn Lead Form Submitted trigger?**

  


The **LinkedIn Lead Form Submitted** trigger enrolls a Contact into a workflow immediately after they submit a LinkedIn Lead Gen form connected to your HighLevel account. Use it to launch instant follow-ups, assign leads to reps, create opportunities, and kick off nurture automations based on where the lead came from and the data they provided.

  


**Trigger Details**

  


  


**Field Name**| **Description**| **Mandatory**  
---|---|---  
**Page**|  The LinkedIn Page that owns the Lead Gen form. Select a specific Page to scope which submissions enter the workflow.| **No**  
  
  


  


### **Operators available in filters**

  


**Operator**| **Description**  
---|---  
**Is (Exact Match)**|  Triggers when the field exactly matches the selected value.  
**Contains Phrase**|  Triggers when the field contains the phrase you enter.  
**Does Not Contain Phrase**|  Triggers when the field does not contain the phrase you enter.  
**Is Empty**|  Triggers when the field has no value.  
**Is Not Empty**|  Triggers when the field has any value.

## **Key Benefits of LinkedIn Lead Form Submitted**

  


Understanding the benefits helps you design faster, cleaner workflows and improve conversion. Use these advantages to guide how you filter, route, and follow up with LinkedIn leads.

  


  * **Speed-to-lead:** triggers instantly on submission so you can text, email, or call right away.


  


  * **Precise routing:** filter by **Page** or mapped custom fields to assign the right owner or pipeline.


  


  * **Cleaner data:** pair with field mapping and deduplication to keep a single, accurate contact record.


  


  * **Automated follow-up:** start nurture sequences, tasks, and opportunity creation without manual work.


  


  * **Reporting clarity:** consistent source tracking helps you measure campaign performance.


* * *

## **Prerequisites**

  


Completing these prerequisites prevents “no leads entering” issues and makes testing straightforward.

  


  * LinkedIn Lead Ads integration connected in **Settings → Integrations** with access to the correct **LinkedIn Page** and **Ad Account**.


  


  * At least one **LinkedIn Lead Gen Form** published for the Page.


  


  * Field mapping planned (e.g., map Email, Phone, Company, Job Title; map niche/qualifiers to matching custom fields in HighLevel).


* * *

## **Filter Logic & Best Practices**

  


Combining filters correctly ensures only qualified submissions enter your automation and prevents accidental enrollments.

  


  * Multiple filters in the trigger are evaluated together (AND logic).


  


  * Start broad (e.g., **Page → Is → Your Page**) and then add qualifiers.


  


  * Avoid over-filtering during initial launch; add qualifiers after confirming leads are flowing.


  


  * Keep Page-specific workflows simple—one workflow per Page is easier to maintain than many complex conditions.


* * *

## **Recommended Workflow Settings**

  


A few workflow settings make testing easier and prevent duplicate outreach.

  


  * **Allow Re-entry:** enable during testing or when a lead might submit more than once; disable if only the first submission should trigger.


  


  * **Stop on Response (optional):** use to pause nurture when a lead replies.


  


  * **Enrollment Logs:** use Execution Logs to verify each lead’s path after submission.

Testing confirms the integration, mapping, and filters are working before you go live.

  


  * In LinkedIn Campaign Manager, submit a test lead for the connected Page and form.


  


  * In HighLevel, open **Contacts** and confirm the Contact was created/updated with mapped fields.


  


  * Open the workflow’s **Enrollment History / Execution Logs** to verify the trigger fired and actions ran.


  


  * Review any filters that prevented enrollment; adjust as needed.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I have to set the Page filter?**

No. Filters are optional, but using **Page** keeps enrollments scoped to a specific LinkedIn Page.

  


**Q: Can I filter by the exact LinkedIn Lead Gen form?**

If your mapping exposes a form identifier or you use a custom field indicating form name, you can filter on that value. Otherwise, use Page scoping and post-trigger conditions.

  


**Q: How are duplicates handled?**

HighLevel attempts to match on identifiers like email/phone. If a match exists, the Contact updates; otherwise, a new Contact is created. Keep dedup preferences tuned and merge when necessary.

  


**Q: Will resubmissions trigger the workflow again?**

That depends on **Allow Re-entry**. Enable it for testing or campaigns where a lead might submit multiple times.

  


**Q: What if mapped fields are empty?**

Use **Is Empty / Is Not Empty** operators to include or exclude those leads, or adjust the LinkedIn form to require those answers.

  


**Q: How fast will leads appear in HighLevel?**

Leads typically sync shortly after submission. Allow a brief delay during testing and check Execution Logs.

  


**Q: Can I run separate workflows for different Pages?**

Yes. Create one workflow per Page or use the **Page → Is** filter with branching actions.

  


**Q: Where can I verify that the trigger fired?**

Open the workflow’s **Enrollment History** and **Execution Logs** to see entries and action paths.
