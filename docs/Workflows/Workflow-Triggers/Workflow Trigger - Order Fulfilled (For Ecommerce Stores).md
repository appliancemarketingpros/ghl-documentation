# **What is the Order Fulfilled Trigger?**

  


When an order’s status changes to “Fulfilled,” this trigger launches a workflow, whether the fulfillment occurs inside a HighLevel Ecommerce Store or via external platforms (e.g., Shopify) and shipping connectors like Shippo or ShipStation. It gives you a single automation point for all fulfillment events, ensuring customer follow-ups, internal tasks, and inventory updates fire exactly when products leave the warehouse.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Order Fulfilled Trigger**

  


The Order Fulfilled trigger helps you:

  


  * Close the customer-experience loop by sending shipment notifications the instant an order is fulfilled.


  


  * Reduce manual work update CRMs, inventory, and accounting systems automatically.


  


  * Segment customers using fulfillment-level data (cart value, product SKU, carrier, etc.).


  


  * Support multi-store brands: one trigger covers both native HighLevel Stores and external sources like Shopify.


* * *

## **Filter Options for Precise Automation**

  


Fine-tune when a workflow should run by combining any of these filters:

  


  * **Cart Value:** Target high- or low-value orders.


  


  * **Fulfilled Products:** Run follow-ups only for specific SKUs.


  


  * **Order Source:** Choose “Store” (HighLevel) or “External.”


  


  * **Order Sub-Source:** When “External,” narrow to Shopify.


  


  * **Shipping Carrier:** Treat FedEx, UPS, USPS, etc., differently.


  


  * **Tracking Number:** Trigger on presence or specific patterns (e.g., overnight shipping codes).


  


These filters let you craft hyper-relevant post-fulfillment experiences.

* * *

## **Store vs. External Order Sources**

  


This trigger listens to two fulfillment pathways:

  


  * Store – Orders created in a HighLevel Ecommerce Store.


  


  * External – Orders synced from third-party storefronts (currently Shopify).


  


By unifying both pathways, you no longer maintain separate workflows for each platform—simply set the Order Source filter and you’re covered.

* * *

## **Transition from “Shopify Order Fulfilled (Deprecating Soon)”**

  


HighLevel has renamed the legacy Shopify-only trigger to “Shopify Order Fulfilled (Deprecating Soon).” Existing workflows continue working, but new automations should use the Ecommerce Stores Order Fulfilled trigger to future-proof setups and gain access to the full filter set above.

* * *

## **Shipping-Integration Compatibility**

  


Fulfillment events pushed in from Shippo, ShipStation, and other connected shipping tools will also fire this trigger, allowing one centralized workflow regardless of where labels are created.

* * *

## **How To Setup the Order Fulfilled Trigger**

  


A well-configured trigger ensures customers hear from you exactly when their package ships. Follow these steps:

  


### **Open Workflows**

  


From the left navigation, click **Automation** to access your workflow tools. On the **Workflow List** page, click **\+ Create Workflow** to start a new workflow (or open an existing workflow you want to update).

### **Add Trigger**

  


In the workflow builder, click **Add Trigger** to define what event will start the workflow. This creates the entry point for your automation before you add any actions.

### **Select Trigger**

  


In the **Add Trigger** panel, scroll to **Ecommerce Stores** and select **Order Fulfilled**. This ensures the workflow starts the moment an order is marked fulfilled.

### **Name Trigger**

  


Enter a clear **Workflow Trigger Name** (for example, “Order Fulfilled – Store + Shopify”). A descriptive name makes it easier to find and manage the trigger later, especially in workflows with multiple starting points.

### **Add Filters**

  


Under **Filters** , click **Add filters** to control which fulfillment events should enroll in the workflow. Using filters helps you avoid unnecessary enrollments and keeps your follow-ups relevant to the order details.

### **Pick Filter**

  


Open the filter dropdown and select the first condition you want to apply (for example, **Cart Value** or **Order Source**). Choosing the right filter type is what tells HighLevel _which_ part of the fulfillment data to evaluate.

### **Cart Value**

  


Choose **Cart Value** from the filter list to target orders based on how much the customer spent. This is a simple way to route higher-value purchases into VIP follow-ups or exclude low-value orders from certain automations.

  


### **Set Cart Rules**

  


After choosing **Cart Value** , select an operator (like **Greater than** or **Between**) and enter the value(s) you want to target. This is useful for routing higher-value orders into premium experiences while excluding low-value purchases.

###   


  


### **Filter Products**

  


Select **Fulfilled Products** and choose an operator like **Contains any** to include specific items or **Is none of** to exclude them. This lets you tailor post-purchase messaging based on what was actually fulfilled, not just what was ordered.

### **Select Source**

  


Set **Order Source** to choose where the fulfilled order originated, such as **Store** or **External**. This is important for brands running multiple storefronts because it helps you segment automation behavior by platform.

### **Choose Sub-Source**

  


If you set **Order Source** to **External** , use **Order Sub Source** to narrow the trigger to a specific platform like **Shopify**. This keeps external order automations precise while still using the unified **Order Fulfilled** trigger.

### **Filter Carrier**

  


Select **Shipping Carrier** and choose an operator like **Contains Phrase** or **Is Not Empty** based on your goal. If you use **Contains Phrase** , type the carrier name and press **Enter/Return** to add it, which helps you customize messaging by carrier or shipping method.

### **Require Tracking**

  


Choose **Tracking Number** and set the operator to **Is Not Empty** when you only want the workflow to run once tracking exists. This prevents premature notifications and ensures customers receive messages with actionable shipment details.

### **Save Trigger**

  


After confirming your trigger name and filters, click **Save Trigger** to apply the configuration. Saving is required before you can reliably build and publish the rest of the workflow actions based on this fulfillment event.

  


Save, publish, and test by fulfilling a test order in your store or via Shopify.

  


  * (Optional) Toggle **Allow Multiple** if you expect multiple shipments per order.


  


  * Add post-fulfillment actions examples:

    * Send email/SMS with tracking link.

    * Add customer to a “Shipped” pipeline stage.

    * Notify the warehouse Slack channel.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does the trigger fire on partial fulfillments?**

Yes each time an item group is marked Fulfilled, the workflow runs (use filters to control duplicates).

  


**Q: Will my old “Shopify Order Fulfilled” workflows break?**

No. They keep running, but we recommend migrating before the legacy trigger is retired.

  


**Q: Can I delay the follow-up email until the tracking number is live?**

Yes add a Wait step “until tracking URL is not empty” or delay by X minutes after the trigger.

  


**Q: How do I stop duplicate notifications on split shipments?**

Enable the Tracking Number filter and choose “Is Not Empty” so only shipments with new tracking numbers trigger.

  


**Q: Does marking an order “Delivered” retrigger anything?**

No the Order Fulfilled trigger fires only when status changes to Fulfilled. Use other triggers for delivery-stage automations.

  


**Q: Is WooCommerce supported?**

Not yet. Use External > Sub-Source filters as new platform integrations become available.
