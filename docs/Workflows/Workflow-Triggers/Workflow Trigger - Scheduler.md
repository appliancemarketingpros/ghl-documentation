# **What is the Workflow Scheduler Trigger?**

  


The Workflow Scheduler Trigger is a native, **contactless** trigger that starts a workflow on a schedule you define—no contact enrollment required. It’s purpose‑built for recurring jobs like daily summaries, weekly performance posts, spreadsheet syncs, and web-hook pings. All run times follow your **account timezone** , with clear status indicators so you always know it’s working.

## **Key Benefits of the Workflow Scheduler Trigger**

  


This section explains how Scheduler improves reliability and design simplicity for time‑driven automations while reducing maintenance costs compared to workarounds.  
  


  * **Clock‑based automation** : Start workflows exactly when you need—hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, on a specific date/time, or via cron.  
  


  * **Contactless by design** : Run ops tasks without enrolling contacts. Contact‑only actions are automatically skipped to avoid failures.  
  


  * **Timezone aware** : Schedules run according to your **account timezone** to keep reporting and operations consistent.  
  


  * **Built‑in safeguards** : **Skip Weekends** and **Stop On** (end date) help ensure compliance with business rules.  
  


  * **Safe to publish** : Use **Check Trigger Schedule** to preview the next five executions before you go live.  
  


  * **Integrations ready** : Pair with actions like **Webhook (Outbound)** , **Google Sheets** , **Airtable** , **Slack** , internal email/SMS to teammates, Custom Values, and task creation for powerful ops automations.

## **Advanced (Cron) Scheduling**

  


When presets aren’t enough, use cron to describe complex cadences (lists, ranges, and step values).   
  


  * **Syntax:** Standard cron format: *minute *hour *day *month *weekday.  


  * **Examples:**  


    * '0 9 * * 1' (Mondays at 9 AM),  


    * '30 14 1 * *' (1st of month at 2:30 PM),  


    * '0 */2 * * *' (every 2 hours).

  


    
    
    **Note:** Expressions that run more than once per hour are not allowed.

## **Skip Weekends & Stop On**

  


Guardrails help you respect business calendars and project timelines. Use **Skip Weekends** to automatically avoid Saturday/Sunday, and **Stop On** to end the schedule on a specific date/time.  
  


  * **Skip Weekends:** Removes Saturday/Sunday occurrences from applicable schedules (Daily, Weekly, Every N days, Cron patterns that include weekends).  
  


  * **Stop On:** Sets a final date/time after which **future** executions stop.  
  


  * Works with Preview: both options are reflected in the next five executions list.

## **Contactless Actions & Skip Behavior**

  


Scheduler is meant for **contactless** operations. Steps that require a contact context won’t run; the workflow continues to the next supported step.  
  


  * **Good fits:** Web-hook (Outbound), Custom Web-hook, Google Sheets, Airtable, Slack, Internal Email/SMS to teammates, Update/Set Custom Values, Create Task.  
  


  * **Skipped in contactless runs:** Any step that explicitly needs a contact (for example, “Send SMS to Contact”).  
  


  * **Result:** Skipped steps are noted in Execution Logs; downstream steps continue if they don’t require contact data.

## **How to Use the Workflow Scheduler Trigger**

  


Follow this guided setup to create a schedule, validate run times, and publish confidently.  
  


  1. Go to **Automations → Workflows**.

  4. **Choose an interval type** :  
  


     * **Custom** (Nth weekday like 2nd Friday / 4th Monday; supports multiple times)  
  


     * **Daily** (one or more times in a day)  
  


     * **Weekly** (select days of week + time)  
  


     * **Monthly** (choose day 1–31 or **Last** \+ time)  
  


     * **Every N days** (e.g., every 2 days at 9:00 AM)  
  


     * **One‑off date/time** (run once)  
  


     * **Advanced (cron‑style)** for complex schedules

  7. **Preview** the next run times using **Check Trigger Schedule** to confirm cadence (shows the next five executions).

  8. **Add actions** suited for contactless runs (e.g., **Web-hook (Outbound)** , **Slack** , **Google Sheets** , **Airtable** , internal email/SMS to teammates, Custom Values, Create Task).  
  


  9. **Publish** the workflow. Scheduler will start running at the configured times from now on.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q. Is Scheduler contactless?**

Yes. It does not enroll contacts. Steps that require a contact are skipped; the run continues to the next supported step.

  


**Q. Does Scheduler backfill missed executions?**

No. Scheduler triggers on upcoming times while the workflow is **Published**. Past occurrences are not executed retroactively.

  


**Q. Can I schedule multiple times in a single day?**

Yes. Daily and Custom options support multiple times.

  


**Q. How does “Skip Weekends” work?**

**Q. What does “Stop On” do?**

It sets a final date/time after which future scheduled runs will stop.

  


**Q. What actions work best with Scheduler?**

Contactless actions such as **Web-hook (Outbound)** , **Google Sheets** , **Airtable** , **Slack** , internal notifications, Custom Values, and task creation.
