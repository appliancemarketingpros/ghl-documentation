# **What is the Product Review Submitted Trigger?**

When a shopper clicks “Submit review” on any HighLevel store product, this workflow trigger captures the event, pulls in the review details (rating, headline, comment, reviewer info, store, and product), and immediately launches the automation you define. 

  


It lives under Automations → Workflows → Add Trigger → Ecommerce Stores.

### **Name Trigger**

### **Add Filters**

  


Use **Add filters** to define the conditions a review must meet to enroll in this workflow. Add one or more criteria product, rating, store, comment keywords, or reviewer email/name and use **Require All** vs **Require Any** to narrow or broaden targeting; leave filters off to capture every review.

### **Global Product Filter**

  


Under **Filters** , select **Global Product** with the operator **Is** , then pick the single catalog item this workflow should watch. This limits the trigger to reviews submitted for that exact product useful for launches, VIP items, or product-specific follow-ups.

### **Review Comment Filter**

  


Add a **Review Comment** filter and choose **Contains Phrase** to target reviews that mention specific terms (e.g., “shipping,” “refund,” “size”). You can add multiple phrases to route sentiment-specific feedback, or use **Is Not Empty** to include any review that contains a written comment.

### **Review Headline Filter**

Fire workflows based on the headline field perfect for spotting empty or vague titles you’d like customers to clarify. Operators include Contains a phrase and Is Not Empty.

  


### **Review Rating Filter (Star)**

  


The **Review Rating (star)** filter lets you control which review star ratings (1–5) are allowed to trigger your workflow. It’s used to separate automations by sentiment for example, routing low ratings to support for fast resolution and sending 5-star reviewers into advocacy, referral, or social proof workflows.

  


The **Review Rating (star)** filter supports multiple operators to control exactly which reviews can enroll in your workflow. Use **Is any of** to trigger on selected star ratings, or **Is none of** to exclude specific ratings while allowing everything else. For edge cases, **Is empty** targets missing ratings, and **Is not empty** ensures only reviews with a star rating are included.

### **Store Filter**

  


Add a **Store Name** filter to limit which storefront(s) can fire this workflow ideal when your sub-account manages multiple Ecommerce Stores. Choose an operator such as **Is any of** (include selected stores), **Is none of** (exclude), or **Is empty/Is not empty** for edge-case handling.

###   


###   


### **User Email & User Name Filters**

  


Use the **User Email & User Name** filters to prioritize or exclude specific reviewers (VIPs, affiliates, internal testers, suspected spammers). They compare the reviewer’s submitted email or name with operators like equals, contains, is empty/not empty and can be combined with rating, product, or keyword filters for precision. 

  


Apply them to escalate low-star VIP reviews, route influencer feedback to marketing, or suppress automated replies to disposable/test accounts.

  


  


### **Save Trigger**

  


Saving commits your conditions and returns you to the builder to add actions or branches. Use this moment to test with a sample review and then publish once behavior matches your intent. Test by submitting a dummy review in your store

  


Add downstream actions such as Send Email, Create Task, Slack Notification, etc.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does the trigger fire before or after I approve the review?**

It fires immediately on customer submission approval status does not affect it.

  


**Q: Are contact records required for the workflow to run?**

No. Like other Ecommerce triggers, it can run contact-less, but you can create or update a contact inside the workflow if needed.

  


**Q: Can I use multiple products in the Global Product filter?**

Not at this time only one product per trigger. Create additional triggers for other products.

Yes. If reviews are globally disabled in the store settings, no review events are emitted and the trigger won’t fire.

**Q: How can I prevent accidental replies to 5-star reviews?**

Add a Review Rating “Less than 4” filter so only lower-rated reviews enter the workflow.

  


**Q: Does editing a review re-trigger the workflow?**

No, only the initial submission event triggers it.
