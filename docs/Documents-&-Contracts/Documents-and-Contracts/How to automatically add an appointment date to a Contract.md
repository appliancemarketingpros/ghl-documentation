When a client books a service (like a photography session or consultation), if sending a contract that includes the specific booking date where the client has to sign is a critical part of your process, this article explains how to automate this - whether you have a simple booking process or a more advanced opportunity pipeline.

  


### Objective & Challenge

**Your Goal:** You want a workflow to automatically send a contract that includes the client's specific appointment date and time as soon as they book.

  


**The Challenge:** You can't add an `{{appointment.start_time}}` merge tag directly into a contract template. The "Send Contract" action is designed to pull data from **Contact** or **Opportunity** fields, not directly from the appointment trigger itself.

  


**The Solution:** The solution is to use your workflow to **first, copy the appointment date** into a custom field (on the Contact or Opportunity), and **second, send the contract** that pulls from this new field.

##   


### Prerequisites

Before building the workflow, you must have two things set up:

  1. **A Custom Field to Store the Date:**

     * Navigate to **Settings** > **Custom Fields**.

     * Click **Add Field** and select **Contact** (for the simple method) OR **Opportunity** (for the advanced method).

     * Set the **Field Type** to **Text**.

     * Name it clearly (e.g., "**Session Date** ," "**Event Date,"** or "**Booking Date** ").

     * Click **Save**.

  2. **An Updated Contract Template:**

     * Navigate to **Payments** > **Contracts**.

     * Find and **Clone** your existing template (e.g., "Service Agreement - with Date") or Create a **New Template**.

     * Edit the template and add your new custom field variable:

       * For the Contact method: `{{contact.session_date}}`

       * For the Opportunity method: `{{opportunity.session_date}}`

     * **Save** the template.

\- Use contact custom field in the document template

-OR Use Opportunity custom fields [[Learn more](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000004039-documents-contracts-templates-with-opportunity-custom-values>)] if one contact can have multiple bookings

### Workflow Configuration: Choose Your Method

Choose the method that best fits your business process.

####   


### Method 1: The Simple "Contact" Workflow

This is the most direct method. It's perfect if you don't use an opportunity pipeline for your bookings and simply want to send a contract right after someone books.

  1. **Set Your Trigger:**

     * Add a new workflow and select the **Customer Booked Appointment** trigger.

     * (Optional) Use the **Filters** to select the specific **In calendar** that should run this automation.

  2. **Add the "Update Contact Field" Action:**

     * Click the **(+)** icon to add a new action.

     * Select **Update Contact Field**.

     * **Select Field:** Choose the **Contact** custom field you created (e.g., "Session Date").

     * **Select Value:** Click the **tag icon** and select **Appointment** > **Start Time**. This copies the booking date into your contact's custom field.

  3. **Add the "Send Contract" Action:**

     * Click the **(+)** icon directly _under_ the "Update Contact Field" step.

     * Select the **Send Documents & Contracts** action.

     * In the **Template** dropdown, select the new, updated contract template you created in the "Prerequisites" step.

     * **Save** and **Publish** your workflow.

### 4\. The sent contract will have the booking date prefilled

Method 2: The Advanced "Opportunity" Workflow

This method is for businesses that already have an opportunity-based pipeline. It **finds an existing opportunity** for the contact and updates it with the booking date. You can also set up workflows where post booking, a new opportunity is created and within that information is filled.

  1. **Set Your Trigger:**

     * Add the **Customer Booked Appointment** trigger, and filter for your specific **calendar**.

  2. **Add the "Find Opportunity" Action:**

     * Click the **(+)** icon and select **Find Opportunity**.

     * Set `OPPORTUNITY TO BE FOUND` to **Most recently created opportunity**.

     * Add a **Field** filter: Select your custom field (e.g., **"Session Date"**) and set the condition to **"Is Empty"**. This ensures you only update opportunities that _need_ a date.

  3. **Add the "Update Opportunity" Action:**

     * On the **"Opportunity Found"** branch, click the **(+)** icon.

     * Select the **Update Opportunity** action.

     * **Add field** and select your **Opportunity** custom field (e.g., "Session Date").

     * For the value, click the **tag icon** and select **Appointment** > **Start Time**.

  4. **Add the "Send Contract" Action:**

     * Click the **(+)** icon directly _under_ the "Update Opportunity" step.

     * Select the **Send Documents & Contracts** action.

     * In the **Template** dropdown, select your updated **Opportunity** -based contract template.

  5. The sent contract will now have the booking date prefilled.

###   
Final Logic 

Your workflow, whether using Method 1 or 2, must follow this logic:

  1. **Trigger** (Appointment Booked)

  2. **Update Field** (Contact or Opportunity)

  3. **Send Contract** (Using the updated template)  
  
**Troubleshooting Q &A:**  
**-****The contract was sent, but the date field is blank:** This could mean a few things-  
1\. Your workflow order is wrong. The **Update Field** action (Contact or Opportunity) _must_ be placed **before** the **Send Contract** action.  
2\. If you are updating an opportunity then an opportunity should exist for the user who has made the booking. Else, create opportunity action should be used.  
  
**\- The old contract was sent, without the new date field:** Go back into your **Send Contract** action and make sure you have selected your new, cloned template from the dropdown menu, not your old one.
