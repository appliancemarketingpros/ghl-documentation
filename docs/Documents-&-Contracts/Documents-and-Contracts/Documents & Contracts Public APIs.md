## **Key Benefits of Documents & Contracts: Public APIs**

  


Harnessing these APIs delivers efficiency and automation that improve how you manage document workflows.

  


  * **Document listings** : Retrieve a complete list of documents for accurate tracking.  
  


  * **Automated sending** : Send documents directly to contacts without manual intervention.  
  


  * **Template access** : Quickly fetch available templates to generate documents faster.  
  


  * **One-step creation & sending**: Create and send documents from templates with a single API call.  
  


  * **Seamless integration** : Connect document workflows with other apps and systems to reduce friction.


* * *

## **List Documents**

  


The List Documents endpoint lets you retrieve all documents within a specific HighLevel location. This is useful for syncing document records across your CRM, dashboards, or custom apps. For more, refer to [List Documents.](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/60ec57df068f6-list-documents>)

  


  * Pull a full list of documents tied to your account.  
  


  * Keep document records updated in real time.  
  


  * Enable integrations that rely on document metadata.


* * *

## **Send Document**

  


With the Send Document endpoint, you can automatically dispatch an existing document to one or multiple contacts. This reduces time spent manually sending documents and ensures a consistent process. For more, refer to [Send Document.](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/f7326427fcf70-send-document>)

  


  * Select an existing document for sending.  
  


  * Choose one or more contact recipients.  
  


  * Automate document delivery to improve response times.


* * *

## **List Templates**

  


The List Templates endpoint provides access to all available templates in your HighLevel location. This enables developers to fetch templates dynamically when building automated workflows or integrations. For more, refer to [List Templates](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/da393f098cd9e-list-templates>).

  


  * Fetch a central list of templates.  
  


  * Identify the right template for any use case.  
  


  * Power integrations with up-to-date template availability.


* * *

## **Send Template**

  


The Send Template endpoint combines template-based document creation and sending into a single API call. This reduces the workflow to one action, making it easier to build automation at scale. For more, refer to [Send Template.](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/c2be6fd51f42c-send-template>)

  


  * Generate a new document from a template.  
  


  * Immediately send it to designated contacts.  
  


  * Simplify your process with fewer steps.

## **How To Set Up Documents & Contracts: Public APIs**

  


Correctly setting up API access ensures your integrations run smoothly, securely, and at scale. Follow the steps below to configure your HighLevel account for API usage:

  


  


### _**Step 1:** Obtain API Credentials_

Go to **Agency** **Settings > Private Integrations** in your HighLevel account and create a **Private Integration token** (recommended over API keys for enhanced security and access control). 

  

    
    
    **IMPORTANT** : Scopes determine the permissions that the third-party app has to access your account data or perform actions. It's recommended to grant as few scopes as necessary for better account security.

### _**Step 2:** Review API Documentation_

Visit the [Public API documentation portal.](<https://highlevel.stoplight.io/docs/integrations/7d92ac20e1355-documents-and-contracts-api>) Identify which endpoints your workflow requires (List Documents, Send Document, List Templates, Send Template).

### _**Step 3:** Test API Calls_

Use a tool like Postman to make sample requests. Set your authentication header as `Authorization: Bearer <your-token>`. Enter required parameters (document ID, template ID, contact IDs).

  


  


### _**Step 4:** Validate Responses_

Review the JSON output from each call. Confirm that documents or templates are returned and sent successfully.

  


  


### _**Step 5:** Integrate with Your Workflow_

Embed API calls into your CRM, automation scripts, or backend processes. Optionally connect with HighLevel workflows that trigger based on document actions (e.g., “Document Sent” or “Document Signed”).

  


  


### _**Step 6:** Deploy Securely_

Store your API tokens securely, rotate them periodically, and monitor API usage to avoid hitting rate limits.
