# **What is Review Request Messaging?**

  


Review Request messaging automates how your location asks customers for public reviews. HighLevel can send personalized **SMS** and **Email** messages after check‑in, repeat them on a schedule until the customer clicks the review link, and direct traffic to the right review destination using your **Review Link**.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of Review Request Messaging**

  


Understanding the benefits helps you configure requests in a way that fits your business goals.

  


  * **Brand consistency:** Build templates that match your tone and branding across SMS and Email.  
  

  * **Automation:** Schedule when the first request sends and how often to retry until the customer clicks.  
  

  * **Personalization:** Use merge fields like contact and location variables for tailored messages.  
  

  * **Flexibility:** Point customers to Google Business Profile or a custom destination; add multiple links in emails.  
  

  * **Control:** Choose which templates are “Live” and which power each retry in your sequence.


* * *

## **Where You Can Send Review Requests**

  


Once your templates and cadence are configured, you can request reviews from several places in HighLevel. Use the method that best fits your team’s workflow.

  


  * **Reputation → Requests:** Send and track requests in bulk or individually.


  


  * **Contact record:** Open a contact and choose **Send Review Request**.


  


  * **Workflows:** Use the **Review Request** action to automate sends based on triggers (e.g., after an appointment status change).


  


  * **Channels:** SMS and Email are covered here; **WhatsApp Requests** are available in **Reputation → Settings → WhatsApp Requests** (configure separately if needed).


* * *

## **Review Link (Balancing vs. Custom Link)**

  


The Review Link is the URL inserted into your requests. You can allow HighLevel to balance reviews across supported platforms (e.g., Google) or override with a single destination using a custom URL.

  


**Where to find it:** **Reputation → Settings → Review Link**

#### **Enable & Cadence Controls**

  


  * **Review Balancing:** Toggle on to automatically distribute review traffic across configured platforms.


  


  * **Get Reviews on Google:** Connect Google Business Profile (GBP) to route traffic to your Google listing.


  


  * **Custom Link:** Select and paste a specific URL if you want to send all customers to a single page.


  

    
    
    **Tip:** If you use a Custom Link, confirm it opens directly to your review form. If you use Balancing, make sure your integrations are connected.

* * *

## **SMS Requests**

  


SMS requests are quick and personal. Use the enable toggle to start sending, define when the first text goes out, set retry cadence, and create templates that include your review link and optional image.

  


**Navigation:** **Reputation → Settings → SMS Requests**

#### **Enable & Cadence Controls**

  


  * **Enable SMS Review Requests:** Turn the top‑right toggle on.  
  

  * **When to send SMS after check‑in?:** Choose when the first text sends (e.g., Immediately).  
  

  * **Until clicked, repeat this every:** Pick an interval (supports **Custom** with number + **Days**).  
  

  * **Maximum retries:** Set how many follow‑ups can send if the review link isn’t clicked.

### **Create or Edit an SMS template**

  


  1. Click **Create New** (or **Edit** on an existing template).  
  


  2. Choose **Create New from Scratch** or **Select from Pre‑Built Templates**.

In the builder, add a **Template Name**. Optionally enable **Request with Image** (or add an image URL).  
  


  3. Write your message and insert the review link token: {{reputation.review_link}}.  
  


  4. Click **Save**.


  

    
    
    **Cost note:** If you enable Request with Image, the message may send as MMS and incur different carrier fees. Confirm with your provider.

* * *

## **Email Requests**

  


Email requests allow richer branding, images, and multiple review destinations. Turn on the feature, set timing and retries, then create or import templates in the drag‑and‑drop editor.

  


**Navigation:** **Reputation → Settings → Email Requests**

  


**![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155063516219/original/Ilaq69B44toxPAWJoghbVhS0eXlcVYCaCA.png?1769452221)**  


  


#### **Enable & Cadence Controls**

  


  * **Enable Email Review Requests:** Turn the top‑right toggle on.  
  

  * **When to send Email after check‑in?:** Choose the initial delay (e.g., 1 Hour).  
  

  * **Until clicked, repeat this every:** Set the repeat interval (supports **Custom** with number + **Days**).  
  

  * **Maximum retries:** Choose how many follow‑ups to send.


  

    
    
    **Note:** “After check-in” refers to when the Send Review Request action is triggered either manually (from a contact record or Reputation → Requests) or automatically via a Workflow using the Review Request action. 
    The timing you select here determines how long after that trigger the SMS will send.

### **Create or Import an Email template**

  


  1. Click **Create New** → **Create new Template** or **Import from Template Library**.  
  


  2. In the email builder, add your branding and content.  
  


  3. Drag the **Review Link** element into the email (or configure the primary CTA button to use the Review Link).  
  


  4. Save the template.


* * *

## **Select the Live & Retry Templates (Sequence)**

  


Turning on SMS/Email requests isn’t enough, you must also tell HighLevel which template to use for the initial send and for each retry slot. This selection controls exactly what customers receive at each step.

  


  * **For Email:** Click **Set Email Templates** , select the **Live** template and assign templates to each **Retry** slot, then **Save**.


  


  * **For SMS:** Click **Set SMS Templates** , then select your Live/Retry templates and Save.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: What happens after a customer clicks the review link?**

The repeat schedule stops for that channel once the click is detected, preventing additional retries for that contact.

  


**Q: What’s the difference between Review Balancing and a Custom Link?**

**Balancing** distributes traffic across connected review sites (e.g., Google). **Custom Link** sends everyone to a single destination you choose.

  


**Q: Which token should I use in SMS for the review URL?**

Use {{reputation.review_link}}. It automatically uses the Review Link you configured under **Reputation → Settings → Review Link**.

  


**Q: Can emails include more than one review destination?**

Yes. In the Email builder, you can use the **Review Link** element and, in some templates, configure multiple review buttons if supported by your design.

  


**Q: How many retries should I set?**

Most teams start with 2–3 retries. The right number depends on engagement, industry norms, and compliance requirements.

  


**Q: Does adding an image to an SMS change costs?**

It may send as MMS, which can have different carrier pricing. Check your messaging provider’s rates.

  


**Q: Do I need Google Business Profile connected?**

Only if you want to route reviews to Google using Balancing. If you prefer another site or your own page, set a **Custom Link** instead.

  


**Q: Can I automate requests without manual sending?**

Yes. Add the **Review Request** action in a Workflow to trigger sends automatically (e.g., after “check‑in”).
