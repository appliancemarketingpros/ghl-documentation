## **What does this error mean?**

If you see the error below while sending emails to Gmail recipients, it means Gmail has **temporarily limited** emails from your sending IP due to unusual sending behavior:

> **4.7.28 Gmail has detected an unusual rate of unsolicited mail originating from your IP**

This is **not a permanent block or blacklist**. Gmail uses automated systems to protect its users from spam. When it detects a **sudden spike in email volume** or patterns that look unusual, it may temporarily slow down or defer emails from that IP to prevent potential abuse.  
  
  


## **Is my IP blocked?**

No.  
This error indicates a **temporary rate limit** , not a permanent IP block.

  * The `4.x.x` error code means Gmail is **deferring emails** , not rejecting them.

  * Once sending behavior improves, Gmail usually **automatically removes the restriction**.

  * No manual delisting request is required.


  
  


## **Why did this happen?**

This error commonly occurs due to one or more of the following reasons:

  * A **sudden increase in sending volume** , especially to Gmail addresses

  * Sending from a **new or recently warmed IP**

  * Campaigns sent to **inactive or unengaged contacts**

  * Workflow or automation sending emails too frequently

  * Higher-than-normal **spam complaints or low engagement**

  * Email authentication issues (SPF, DKIM, or DMARC misalignment)


Even legitimate senders can trigger this if email volume increases too quickly.  
  


## **How to fix this issue**

###  1\. Reduce sending volume to Gmail

  * Temporarily lower the number of emails sent to `@gmail.com` and `@googlemail.com` addresses

  * Gradually increase volume over time instead of sending large bursts


### 2\. Send only to engaged contacts

  * Focus on users who have recently opened or interacted with your emails

  * Avoid sending to old, inactive, or purchased lists


### 3\. Review automations and workflows

  * Check for workflows that may be sending emails repeatedly or too frequently

  * Pause or adjust any campaigns that caused a sudden spike


  
  


## **How long does recovery take?**

In most cases, Gmail lifts the rate limit **within 24–72 hours** once sending behavior stabilizes. Continued good sending practices help restore normal delivery faster.  
  
  
The `4.7.28` error is a **temporary Gmail protection mechanism** , not a permanent block. By slowing down email volume, sending to engaged users, and following Gmail’s bulk sender best practices, email delivery will recover naturally.
