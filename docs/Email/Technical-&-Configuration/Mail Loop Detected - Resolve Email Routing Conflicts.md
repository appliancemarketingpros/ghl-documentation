# Mail Loop Detection Issues - Complete Troubleshooting Guide

## What's Happening?

Your email gets trapped in an endless routing cycle between mail servers, creating an infinite delivery attempt cycle. Mail servers detect this pattern and reject the message to prevent system overload. This prevents delivery and can impact your sender reputation if not resolved quickly.

Mail loop detection occurs when email forwarding rules, MX record configurations, or automated responses create circular routing patterns. Unlike other delivery issues, mail loops require immediate attention as they can quickly escalate and affect your entire sending infrastructure.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying Mail Loop Issues

Look for these bounce messages that indicate mail loop problems:

### Common Loop Detection Messages

  * The message was rejected because it was caught in a routing loop between mail servers.


* * *

## Understanding Mail Loop Causes

### Common Loop Scenarios

**Email Forwarding Loops:**

  * Email A forwards to Email B, which forwards back to Email A
  * Catch-all addresses that forward to themselves
  * Multiple forwarding rules creating circular references
  * Auto-responders replying to automated messages


**DNS and MX Record Issues:**

  * Duplicate or conflicting MX entries
  * Incorrect priority ordering in MX records
  * Misconfigured mail server routing
  * DNS propagation conflicts


### Specific Considerations

Workflow-Related Loops:

  * Workflows triggering each other in circular patterns
  * Email-based triggers creating infinite responses
  * Auto-responders conflicting with external systems
  * Conversation forwarding creating routing conflicts


Domain Configuration Issues:

  * Incomplete domain setup causing routing problems
  * Authentication conflicts with forwarding rules
  * Multiple email services competing for the same domain
  * Cached routing information causing persistent loops


* * *

## Step-by-Step Mail Loop Resolution

### Step 1: Immediate Diagnosis

**Check your domain configuration:**

  1. **Navigate to Email Services:**
     * Go to **Settings** → **Email Services** → **Dedicated Domains and IP**
     * Check for any warning indicators or incomplete setup steps
     * Verify domain authentication status
  2. **Review recent changes:**
     * Check if you've recently modified email forwarding rules
     * Review any new workflow implementations
     * Look for changes in conversation email integration
  3. **Examine bounce reports:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Emails** → **Reports**
     * Look for patterns in bounce messages
     * Identify affected domains or email addresses


### Step 2: External Diagnostic Assessment

**For Domain Configuration Issues:**

#### MX Record Analysis Tools

  * **MXToolbox.com** \- Comprehensive email server testing
  * **DNSChecker.org** \- Global DNS propagation verification
  * **WhatsmyDNS.net** \- DNS lookup verification
  * **IntoDNS.com** \- Complete DNS health check


**For Email Header Analysis:**

  * **Collect email headers:**
    * From bounced emails, copy complete headers
    * Look for all "Received:" lines showing routing path
    * Document repeated server names or IP addresses
  * **Use header analysis tools:**
    * **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer**
    * **Google Admin Toolbox Message Header**
    * **Microsoft Message Header Analyzer**


### Step 3: Configuration Review

**Domain Authentication Check:**

  1. Navigate to **Settings → Email Services → Dedicated Domain & IP → [Your Domain] → Authentication**
  2. Verify SPF record
  3. Ensure DMARC policy isn't causing rejection and re-routing


**Workflow and Automation Review:**

  1. **Check automation workflows:**
     * Go to **Automation** → **Workflows**
     * Look for workflows triggering each other in circular patterns
     * Review email-based triggers and responses
     * Identify any workflows that might create reply loops
  2. **Review email templates:**
     * Navigate to **Marketing** → **Emails** → **Templates**
     * Check auto-responder settings
     * Review any automated email responses
  3. **Examine conversation settings:**
     * Go to **Conversations** → **Settings** → **Email Integration**
     * Check email forwarding configurations
     * Review any routing conflicts


### Step 4: External Infrastructure Resolution

**Eliminate Forwarding Loops:**

  * **Domain registrar/hosting provider review:**
    * Log into your domain management panel
    * Review all email forwarding rules and aliases
    * Remove circular forwarding configurations
    * Disable catch-all settings that forward to themselves
  * **Auto-responder management:**
    * Disable auto-responders that reply to automated messages
    * Configure proper filtering to prevent reply loops
    * Set up appropriate sender exclusions


**DNS Record Optimization:**

  * **MX record cleanup:**
    * Remove duplicate or conflicting MX entries
    * Ensure proper priority ordering (lower numbers = higher priority)
    * Verify all MX records point to valid mail servers
    * Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation


* * *

## Advanced Resolution Techniques

### Domain Reconfiguration

**When standard fixes don't work:**

  1. Navigate to **Settings → Email Services → Sending Domains**
  2. Consider removing and re-adding your domain to reset cached routing
  3. Ensure all DNS records are properly configured before re-adding
  4. Test with small volume after reconfiguration


**Campaign Management During Resolution:**

  * **Pause affected campaigns:**
    * Go to **Marketing** → **Campaigns** → **[Campaign Name]** → **Pause**
    * Temporarily halt campaigns experiencing loop issues
    * Prevent further reputation damage
  * **Document evidence:**
    * Collect bounce messages and error logs
    * Save email headers showing loop patterns
    * Track affected domains and volumes


### Testing and Validation Process

**Small-scale testing:**

  1. Use **Marketing → Emails → Send Test Email**
  2. Send to various providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo)
  3. Monitor email headers for proper routing paths
  4. Verify no loop indicators in delivery reports


**Gradual campaign resumption:**

  * Start with small segments of highly engaged contacts
  * Monitor delivery metrics closely
  * Gradually increase volume while watching for loop recurrence
  * Document successful delivery patterns


* * *
