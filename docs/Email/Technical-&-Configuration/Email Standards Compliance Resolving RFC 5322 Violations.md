# RFC 5322 Non-Compliant Email Messages: Complete Troubleshooting Guide

## What's Happening?

Your emails are being rejected by recipient servers because they don't meet the technical formatting standards required by RFC 5322 - the official specification that governs email format. These rejections occur when your email headers, sender addresses, or message structure violate established email protocols, causing receiving servers to refuse delivery entirely.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying RFC 5322 Compliance Issues

### Bounce Message Examples

  * "The email was rejected because the From header or domain does not meet required technical standards"
  * "The message was rejected due to protocol or formatting issues, causing the connection to be refused"
  * "The message was rejected due to a mail loop or excessive hops, violating email transmission standards"
  * "The sender address or message format does not meet email standards or is not accepted by the recipient server"
  * "The email message does not meet required formatting or header standards, such as missing or invalid From header or disallowed characters"
  * "The message was blocked due to content or attachments violating Gmail's security or content guidelines"
  * "The email message format or headers do not comply with required standards"
  * "The sender address format does not comply with email standards (RFC 5321/5322)"


* * *

## Understanding RFC 5322 Compliance

### Key Concepts

**RFC 5322 Defines:**

  * Proper email header structure and formatting requirements
  * Valid sender address formats and character restrictions
  * Message routing protocols and hop limitations
  * Required and optional header fields for email messages
  * Character encoding standards for international content


### Common Compliance Violations

Header Issues:

  * Missing or malformed From header
  * Invalid characters in sender name or address
  * Improper date formatting in headers
  * Excessive or malformed Received headers


Address Format Problems:

  * Special characters not properly encoded
  * Missing angle brackets around email addresses
  * Invalid domain name formatting
  * Improper use of display names


Message Structure Issues:

  * Mail loops causing excessive hops
  * Line length violations (over 998 characters)
  * Missing required message boundaries


* * *

## Step-by-Step RFC 5322 Compliance Resolution

### Step 1: Audit All Sender Configurations

**Instructions:**

  1. **Review Campaign Sender Settings:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Email** → **Campaigns**
     * Open each campaign experiencing delivery issues
     * Click on the email step within your campaign
     * Review the "From Name" and "From Email" fields for proper formatting
  2. **Check Workflow Email Actions:**
     * Go to **Automation** → **Workflows**
     * Open workflows that include email actions
     * Click on each "Send Email" action in your workflow
     * Review sender name and email address configuration
  3. **Audit Bulk Action Email Settings:**
     * Go to **Contacts** → **Bulk Actions**
     * Review the sender name and email fields in bulk action setup
     * Ensure consistency with your authenticated sending domains
     * Verify that bulk email sender information matches campaign standards
  4. **Standardize All Sender Information:**
     * Ensure sender names contain only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and basic punctuation
     * Remove special characters like quotes, brackets, or symbols from sender names
     * Verify email addresses follow the format: name@domain.com without special characters
     * Keep display names under 64 characters
     * Use consistent sender name formatting across all email touchpoints
     * Ensure all sender email addresses are properly authenticated
     * Verify reply-to addresses are valid and properly formatted


#### Sender Configuration Success

  * All campaign sender addresses follow proper email format standards
  * Workflow email actions use consistent, compliant sender information
  * Bulk action emails maintain proper formatting and structure
  * Display names contain only standard characters across all email touchpoints


### Step 2: Validate Email Template Structure

**Instructions:**

  1. **Access email templates:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Emails** → **Templates**
     * Open templates that are experiencing delivery issues
  2. **Fix template compliance issues:**
     * Verify that line lengths don't exceed 998 characters
     * Test templates across different email clients


### Step 3: Use External Validation Tools

  


  1. **Mail-Tester.com:**
     * Send a test email from your campaign, workflow, or bulk action to the provided address
     * Review the detailed compliance report
     * Address any RFC 5322 violations identified
  2. **MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer:**
     * Copy email headers from a delivered message
     * Paste into the header analyzer tool
     * Review compliance warnings and errors
  3. **RFC 5322 Validator Tools:**
     * Use online RFC compliance checkers
     * Validate email address formats before importing contacts
     * Test message structure for standards compliance


* * *

## Prevention Best Practices

### Ongoing Monitoring

  * **Regular sender audits:** Review sender information in campaigns, workflows, and bulk actions monthly
  * **Template validation:** Check all email templates for compliance before deployment
  * **External testing:** Use Mail-Tester.com weekly to catch issues early
  * **Bounce monitoring:** Watch for RFC compliance error patterns in delivery reports


### Configuration Standards

## Still Having Issues?

If you continue to experience RFC 5322 compliance challenges:

  1. **Document specific errors:** Collect exact bounce messages and identify which sending method triggered them
  2. **Test systematically:** Send test emails from campaigns, workflows, and bulk actions separately
  3. **Review recent changes:** Check for any modifications to sender information or templates
  4. **Cross-reference settings:** Ensure consistency across all email sending methods in our platform
