# **What is Preference Management?**

  


Preference Management helps businesses stay compliant by honoring each contact’s communication choices including whether they want to receive emails, and if so, what types of emails they prefer to receive. This reduces unwanted outreach, minimizes the risk of being marked as spam, and supports healthier email deliverability.

  


With Preference Management, each location can create and manage custom communication (preference) categories that align with its marketing needs. These categories can be linked directly to campaigns, enabling the system to automatically respect every contact stated preferences.

  


When a contact opts out of a specific preference type, any future campaigns assigned to that category will automatically exclude them, even if they were part of the original campaign audience. This ensures more relevant messaging, stronger compliance, and a more personalized experience for every contact.

## **Key Benefits of Preference Management**

  


  * **Compliance-First Communication:** Automatically uphold opt-out decisions at a category level.  
  

  * **Healthier Email Deliverability:** Reduce spam complaints and unwanted messages.  
  

  * **Personalized Engagement:** Send more relevant content aligned with contact preferences.  
  

  * **Location-Level Customization:** Each location defines its own communication categories based on its marketing strategy.

## **Preference Types**

  


Preference Types are the granular categories that are the foundation of Preference Management. Create as many as you need to reflect the distinct themes of your email program (e.g., Newsletters, Promotions, Event Updates). These categories live under **Settings** → **Preference Management Hub** and can be edited, disabled, or deleted at any time.

## **Associating Preferences with Campaigns**

  


Linking a campaign to a preference category tells the system “why” you’re emailing. This allows HighLevel to filter audiences based on contact choices before delivery. When a contact opts out of that category, they are automatically kept out of current and future sends for that category, even if the contact is still on your static list.

## **Automatic Audience Filtering**

  


If a contact has opted out of a specific preference type, they will be automatically excluded from any campaign assigned to that category (even if they were originally included in the campaign audience). This ensures accurate targeting and prevents unwanted emails from being sent.

  


Once preferences are set, the system will:  
  


  * Automatically remove contacts from campaigns that conflict with their choices  
  

  * Enforce category-level opt-outs, even if the contact appears in the original campaign audience

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: How does category opt‑out relate to global unsubscribe?**  
Category opt‑out suppresses only the selected topics. A global unsubscribe opts the user out from all marketing email from the location.

  


**Q: Can contacts manage their own preferences?**  
When Preference Management is enabled, the unsubscribe link includes a 'Manage your preferences' link where contacts can manage their own preferences.

  


**Q: Do emails sent from workflows honor category preferences?**  
Yes. Automatic filtering removes contacts whose preferences conflict with the campaign’s categories, regardless of how they were added to the audience.
