Sender Domains determine which domain is used to send an email campaign and whether the From Email address is valid and compliant. Proper sender domain selection helps prevent campaign failures, protects domain reputation, and improves inbox placement.

  


Sender Domain behavior applies **only to****LC Email** locations. SMTP-based email sending follows its existing workflow.

# **What Are Sender Domain Settings?**

  


Sender Domain Settings are available when you send or schedule an email campaign under Marketing → Emails → Campaigns. They determine which domain is used to send a campaign and ensure that the From Email address aligns with that domain.

  


Email providers expect this alignment to authenticate messages correctly. When the sending domain and sender email do not match, campaigns may fail to send or be filtered as spam. With Sender Domain Settings, you can choose the appropriate sending domain for each campaign, validate the sender email in real time, and prevent campaigns from launching if domain compliance requirements are not met.

  


This per-campaign control helps reduce delivery issues and improves overall sending reliability. Once a campaign is sent or scheduled, the selected sender domain is locked for that campaign.

## **Key Benefits of Sender Domain Settings**

  


  * **Fewer Send Failures:** Prevents campaigns from sending with mismatched or non-compliant sender domains, reducing hard errors at send time.


  


  * **Better Deliverability:** Ensures proper domain alignment, helping email providers authenticate messages and improving inbox placement.


  


  * **Per-Campaign Control:** Allows you to choose the most appropriate sending domain for each campaign instead of relying on a single default.


  


  * **Automatic Safeguards:** Automatically adjusts supported sender emails and surfaces clear warnings when manual action is required.


  


  * **Clear Visibility:** Provides real-time validation and quick access to domain configuration, making issues easy to identify and resolve.

## **How Sender Domains Behave in Different Scenarios**

  


**Shared Domains (Agency or HighLevel)**

  


When a campaign uses a shared sending domain, public email addresses such as Gmail or Yahoo are supported. HighLevel automatically adjusts the sender email behind the scenes to meet compliance requirements, allowing the campaign to send successfully without user intervention.

  


**Single Dedicated Domain**

  


If a location has one verified dedicated domain, it is automatically selected during the send or schedule step. The sender email must match this domain, and real-time validation ensures the campaign is compliant before sending.

  


**Multiple Dedicated Domains**

  


When multiple verified domains are available, you can choose a specific domain for the campaign or select All Domains. Choosing All Domains allows HighLevel to rotate sending across eligible domains based on internal rules to help manage deliverability at scale.

  


The table below summarizes how sender domains behave across common campaign scenarios.

  


**Scenario**| **What the user enters**| **What happens**  
---|---|---  
Shared domain + public email| name@gmail.com| Email is auto-refactored for compliance  
One dedicated domain| Matching domain email| Domain auto-selected and validated  
Multiple domains (single)| Selects one domain| Uses selected domain only  
Multiple domains (All Domains)| Enters marketing| Domains rotate automatically  
Dedicated domain mismatch| Domain ≠ sender email| Send is blocked  
Domain not verified| DNS incomplete| Warning shown with fix link

## **How to Set Up and Configure Sender Domains for a Campaign**

Open the **Sender Domain** dropdown to see which sending options are available for your location.

  


The **Sender Domain** dropdown shows the sending options available for your location and changes based on how your email domains are configured. 

  


If you’re using **shared domains** , public email addresses are supported and automatically adjusted for compliance; if **one dedicated domain** is available, it is pre-selected and must match the sender email; and if **multiple dedicated domains** are configured, you can choose a specific domain or select **All Domains** to allow HighLevel to rotate sending across eligible domains to manage deliverability.

If a warning or error appears, Review Domain Configuration using hyperlink to check things like domain verification, warm-up status, or IP assignment.

When configuring sender domains, you may see different types of messages. **Warnings** indicate a potential issue such as a sender email and sender domain mismatch where the campaign can still be sent, but matching domains is recommended to reduce the risk of spam filtering. **Errors** indicate blocking issues where the campaign cannot be sent until the problem is fixed.

Once everything looks good, finish sending or schedule the campaign. The sender domain you choose is locked to the campaign when it’s sent or scheduled.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Why am I seeing a warning even though my campaign can still be sent?**

Warnings appear when there is a potential deliverability issue, such as a sender email and domain mismatch. The campaign can still be sent, but matching domains is recommended to avoid spam filtering.

  


**Q:What happens if my sender domain is not verified or warmed up?**

The campaign cannot be sent until the domain is verified and meets readiness requirements. A warning or error message will guide you to complete the required setup.

  


**Q: Can I use a different Reply-To address than the sender domain?**

Yes. The Reply-To address is independent of the sender domain and can point to any valid email address.

  


**Q: Does selecting “All Domains” affect email deliverability?**

No. When selected, HighLevel sends emails only from verified and warmed domains, rotating them based on internal rules to help manage reputation and maintain deliverability.
