## New ESP Block Policy - Implementation Timeline

**Effective Date: [12th Feb 2026]**

This new ESP Block Policy will be implemented on ****12th Feb 2026****. Current users will receive advance notification and have time to review their email practices before enforcement begins.

**What you should do now:**

  * Review your current bounce classification data
  * Implement recommended email authentication and best practices
  * Clean your email lists and improve content quality
  * Monitor your ESP block rates closely


  


## URGENT: Action Required Within 24-48 Hours (When Policy is Active)

**Your GoHighLevel sub-account has been temporarily restricted from sending emails due to ESP (Email Service Provider) blocks.** This is part of our Anti-Spam Policy designed to protect your sender reputation and ensure high deliverability rates.

##   
What Are ESP Blocks?

ESP blocks occur when major email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, etc.) reject your emails due to:

  * Authentication failures (DMARC, SPF, DKIM issues)
  * Poor sender reputation
  * Content that appears spam-like
  * Policy violations
  * Technical configuration problems


**Unlike regular bounces, ESP blocks are calculated separately and trigger immediate restrictions to protect your long-term email deliverability.**

  


## New ESP Block System

ESP Block Rate| Action| Duration| Block Level  
---|---|---|---  
**3%**|  Warning Email Sent| Immediate notification| Pre-Block Warning  
**5%**|  Email sending suspended| 12 hours| **1st block**  
**3% (after 1st block)**|  Critical Warning Email Sent| Immediate notification| Pre-2nd Block Warning  
**5% (after 1st block)**|  Email sending suspended| 24 hours| **2nd block**  
**3% (after 2nd block)**|  Final Warning Email Sent| Immediate notification| Pre-3rd Block Final Warning  
**5% (after 2nd block)**| **PERMANENT SUSPENSION**|  Permanent| **3rd block - FINAL**  
  
**Critical:** **All blocks are reset after 7 consecutive days of maintaining ESP block rates below 1%.**

**In this release, email sending will not be permanently disabled. Each block will be temporary and limited to a 24-hour duration only.**  
  


If your email service is**blocked** due to **ESP Block Detected** , you will see the following error message displayed as a **top banner** inside the affected subaccount:

> **Email sending is blocked due to a high number of spam blocks from email providers.**

This block is enforced to protect email deliverability and prevent further reputation damage with Email Service Providers (ESPs).

     * Identify patterns in ESP blocks
     * Check which email providers are blocking you most


### Phase 2: Implement Email Best Practices

  1. **Email Authentication Setup**
     * Configure SPF records to include GoHighLevel's sending IPs
     * Set up DKIM signing for your domain
     * Implement DMARC policy (start with p=none for monitoring)
     * Verify all DNS records are properly configured
  2. **List Hygiene and Quality**
     * Remove all bounced and invalid email addresses
     * Implement double opt-in for new subscribers

### Industry Standards

  * Major ESPs are increasingly strict about email quality
  * Authentication requirements are now mandatory
  * Content filtering has become more sophisticated
  * Sender reputation affects all future campaigns

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When does this new policy take effect?

The ESP Block System will be implemented on ****12 Feb 2026**** , giving all users 30 days to prepare and optimize their email practices.  
  


### What happens to my current ESP blocks?

Your ESP block history will reset on the implementation date. However, we strongly recommend addressing any current issues before the policy goes live to ensure smooth operations.  
  


### How do block reset?

Blocks reset after 7 consecutive days of maintaining ESP block rates below 1%. However, if you receive 3 blocks within any 7-day period, permanent suspension will occur.  
  


### Can permanent suspensions be reversed?

Permanent unblocking **cannot be done automatically**. A manual review by the GHL Support team is required. Also Please note that unblocking is not guaranteed and depends on compliance with email best practices.. This is why we provide multiple warnings and temporary suspensions before taking final action.  
  


### Will I receive notifications before each block?

Yes, you will receive warning emails when your ESP block rate reaches 3%, giving you time to take corrective action before the 5% threshold triggers a block.  
  


### What if I'm currently above 3% ESP block rate?

Use the preparation period before **12th Feb 2026** to address these issues. The block system will not be enforced until the implementation date, giving you time to fix problems.  
  


### How is this different from regular bounce management?

ESP blocks are calculated separately from regular bounces and have their own block system. Regular bounces (invalid addresses, full mailboxes) are handled differently than ESP blocks (reputation, authentication, policy issues).
