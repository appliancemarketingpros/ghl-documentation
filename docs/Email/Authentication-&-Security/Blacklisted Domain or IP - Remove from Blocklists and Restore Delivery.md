# Resolving Blacklisted URL/IP/Domain Email Blocks

## What's Happening?

Your emails are being blocked because one or more components in your email campaign have been flagged by public blacklists (RBLs/DBLs). This could be your sending IP address, your domain, or URLs included in your email content. Email providers use these blacklists as a first line of defense against spam, and being listed can severely impact your email deliverability across multiple platforms.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying Blacklist Issues

### Bounce Message Examples

  * Email blocked due to listed URLs or IPs/domains on public blacklists (RBLs/DBLs).

## Understanding Blacklist Blocks

### Key Concepts

**Important Information:**

  * Blacklists are third-party databases that track suspicious IPs, domains, and URLs
  * Major email providers (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo) consult multiple blacklists before accepting emails
  * Being blacklisted affects ALL emails from your account, not just specific campaigns
  * Blacklist removal can take 24-72 hours even after resolving the underlying issue
  * Some blacklists automatically remove entries after a period of good behavior


### Common Blacklist Types

IP-Based Blacklists (RBLs):

  * Spamhaus SBL/CSS/XBL/PBL - Most widely used
  * Barracuda Reputation Block List
  * SURBL - Focuses on spam URLs
  * SpamCop - Community-driven reporting


Domain/URL Blacklists (DBLs):

  * Spamhaus DBL - Domain reputation
  * URIBL - URL reputation tracking
  * SURBL - Spam URL realtime blocklist
  * Google Safe Browsing - Malware/phishing protection

## Step-by-Step Blacklist Resolution

### Step 1: Identify What's Blacklisted

**Check Your Sending Infrastructure:**

  1. **Find your sending IP:**
     * Go to **Settings** → **Email Services** → **Sending Domain and IP**
     * Note your configured sending domain and any IP information displayed
     * If using shared infrastructure, contact support for IP details
  2. **Use external blacklist checkers:**
     * Visit MXToolbox.com → Blacklist Check
     * Enter your sending IP address
     * Check your sending domain separately
     * Test any URLs frequently used in your campaigns


### Step 2: Analyze Email Content

**Review Recent Campaigns:**

  1. **Access your campaign history:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Emails** → **Campaigns**
     * Review campaigns sent in the last 7-14 days
     * Look for any new URLs, domains, or shortened links
  2. **Check for problematic content:**
     * Shortened URLs (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
     * Newly registered domains
     * URLs with suspicious extensions (.tk, .ml, .ga)
     * Links to file-sharing services


### Step 3: Submit Delisting Requests

**Contact Blacklist Operators:**

  1. **For Spamhaus listings:**
     * Visit spamhaus.org → SBL/CSS/PBL Removal
     * Enter your IP/domain and follow removal process
     * Provide detailed explanation of remediation steps
  2. **For other major blacklists:**
     * Barracuda: barracudacentral.org/rbl/removal-request
     * SpamCop: spamcop.net → Reporting → Remove
     * SURBL: surbl.org → Whitelist Request


#### Successful Delisting Indicators

  * Blacklist checker shows "Not Listed" status
  * Test emails reach inbox instead of bouncing
  * Bounce rates return to normal levels (under 2%)
  * Email delivery reports show improved acceptance rates


### Step 4: Implement Preventive Measures

**Strengthen Your Email Practices:**

  1. **Update email templates:**
     * Go to ****Marketing** → **Emails** →****Templates**
     * Remove any flagged URLs or domains
     * Replace shortened URLs with full, reputable links
     * Add clear unsubscribe links and physical addresses
  2. **Improve list hygiene:**
     * Go to **Contacts** → **Smart Lists**
     * Create segments for engaged subscribers only
     * Remove bounced and unengaged contacts regularly


* * *

## Recovery Timeline and Expectations

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (0-24 hours)

  * **Expected outcome:** Confirmation of blacklist status and removal request submission


### Phase 2: Delisting Process (24-72 hours)

## Ongoing Monitoring and Prevention

### Weekly Monitoring Routine

  1. **Check blacklist status:**
     * Use MXToolbox.com weekly blacklist monitoring
     * Set up alerts for any new listings
     * Monitor Sender Score at senderscore.org
  2. **Review metrics:**
     * Go to **Reporting** → **Email Analytics**
     * Monitor bounce rates (should stay under 2%)
     * Watch for sudden delivery rate drops


### Best Practices for Prevention

**Content Guidelines:**

  * Use your own domain for all links when possible
  * Avoid URL shorteners unless absolutely necessary
  * Test all URLs before including in campaigns
  * Maintain consistent sending patterns and volumes
  * Include clear sender identification and unsubscribe options
