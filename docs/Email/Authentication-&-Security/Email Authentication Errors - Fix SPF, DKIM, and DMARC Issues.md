## What's Happening?

Your emails are being rejected because your domain failed authentication checks required by recipient email servers. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are security protocols that verify your emails are legitimate and not spoofed. When these authentication methods fail or are missing, major email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo will reject your messages to protect their users from potential spam or phishing attempts.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying Authentication Failures

### Common Authentication Failure Messages

  * "The sender's domain failed DMARC authentication, which is required by the recipient's server"
  * "Message rejected due to failing DMARC authentication or related sender policy checks"
  * "Email rejected due to failed or missing SPF or DMARC authentication for the sending domain"
  * "The sender domain lacks proper SPF authentication, causing delivery to be blocked"
  * "The sender's domain failed DKIM authentication, not meeting recipient's authentication standards"
  * "The From header domain does not align with authenticated SPF or DKIM domains"
  * "Sender was not authenticated, so delivery to the group was blocked by recipient policy"
  * "The sending server failed authentication checks or lacks valid security certificates"


* * *

## Understanding Email Authentication

### Key Concepts

**Email Authentication Trio:**

  * **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** Verifies which servers are authorized to send email from your domain
  * **DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):** Adds a digital signature to verify email authenticity
  * **DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication):** Tells recipients what to do when SPF/DKIM checks fail
  * **Domain Alignment:** Your "From" address must match your authenticated sending domain


### Authentication Failure Categories

SPF Failures:

  * Missing SPF record in DNS
  * Too many DNS lookups in SPF record (exceeds 10 limit)


DKIM Failures:

  * DKIM keys not published in DNS
  * Mismatched DKIM signatures


DMARC Failures:

  * No DMARC policy published
  * DMARC policy set to "reject" without proper SPF/DKIM setup
  * Domain alignment issues between From address and authenticated domain


* * *

## Step-by-Step Authentication Setup

### Step 1: Configure Dedicated Domain

**Instructions:**

  1. **Navigate to Email Settings:**
     * Go to **Settings** → **Email Services** → **Sending Domain**
     * Click **"Add Domain"**
     * Enter your domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com)
  2. **Generate Authentication Records:**
     * Our system will display required DNS records
     * Copy the SPF, DKIM, MX, CNAME and DMARC records provided
     * Keep this page open for reference


### Step 2: Add DNS Records

**Instructions:**

  1. **Access Your DNS Provider:**
     * Log into your domain registrar or DNS hosting provider
     * Navigate to DNS management or DNS zone editor
  2. **Add SPF Record:**
     * Create a new **TXT record**
     * Name/Host: **@** (or leave blank for root domain)
     * Value: Copy the SPF record from our system (typically includes "v=spf1 include:spf.leadconnectorhq.com include:mailgun.org ~all")
  3. **Add DKIM Record:**
     * Create a new **TXT record**
     * Name/Host: Use the DKIM selector provided
     * Value: Copy the DKIM public key
  4. **Add MX Record:**
     * Create a new **MX record**
     * Name/Host: Use the MX selector provided
     * Value: Copy the MX records
  5. **Add CNAME Record(Tracking URL):**
     * Create a new **CNAME record**
     * Name/Host: Use the CNAME selector provided
     * Value: Copy the CNAME records
  6. **Add DMARC Record:**
     * Create a new **TXT record**
     * Name/Host: **_dmarc**
     * Value: Start with "v=DMARC1; p=none;"


#### DNS Propagation Success Indicators

  * Our Platform shows "Verified" status for your domain
  * DNS lookup tools confirm your records are live
  * Authentication test emails pass SPF/DKIM/DMARC checks
  * Bounce rates decrease significantly within 24-48 hours


### Step 3: Verify Authentication Setup

**Instructions:**

  1. **Check Status:**
     * Return to **Settings** → **Email Services** → **Sending Domain**
     * Click **"Verify Domain"** button
     * Wait for all authentication checks to show "Verified"
  2. **External Verification Tools:**
     * Use MXToolbox.com SPF/DKIM/DMARC lookup tools
     * Test with Mail-Tester.com for comprehensive authentication analysis
     * Send test emails to Gmail/Outlook accounts and check headers


### Step 4: Update Email From Addresses

**Instructions:**

  1. **Align From Addresses:**
     * Update all "From" email addresses to use your authenticated domain
     * Example: Change "noreply@anydomain.com" to "noreply@yourdomain.com"
  2. **Update Campaigns and Automations:**
     * Review existing email campaigns and sequences
     * Update From addresses in all active campaigns and Automations
     * Test send to verify authentication passes


* * *

## Recovery Timeline and Expectations

### Phase 1: DNS Propagation (2-48 hours)

  * **Action:** DNS records propagate globally
  * **Expected outcome:** Our platform shows domain as verified, external tools confirm records


### Phase 2: Authentication Recognition (1-7 days)

  * **Action:** Email providers recognize your authentication setup
  * **Expected outcome:** Bounce rates decrease, authentication-related rejections stop


### Phase 3: Reputation Building (2-4 weeks)

  * **Action:** Consistent authenticated sending builds positive reputation
  * **Expected outcome:** Improved inbox placement, higher delivery rates


* * *

## Advanced Authentication Monitoring

### Essential Monitoring Tools

**Free Authentication Checkers:**

  * **MXToolbox.com:** SPF, DKIM, DMARC record lookup and validation
  * **DMARC Analyzer:** Free DMARC record checker and policy validator
  * **Mail-Tester.com:** Comprehensive email authentication testing
  * **Google Admin Toolbox:** Dig tool for DNS record verification


**DMARC Reporting Setup:**

  1. Add reporting email to your DMARC record: "rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@yourdomain.com"
  2. Set up email forwarding for DMARC reports
  3. Use free DMARC analyzers like Postmark's DMARC Digests
  4. Monitor weekly reports for authentication failures


* * *

## Common Authentication Pitfalls

#### Warning Signs to Avoid

  * **Multiple SPF Records:** Only one SPF record per domain is allowed
  * **Immediate DMARC Reject Policy:** Start with "p=none" for monitoring
  * **Missing Include Statements:** Ensure SPF includes all sending services
  * **Subdomain Confusion:** Match your From domain exactly with authenticated domain
  * **DNS Syntax Errors:** Extra spaces or quotes can break authentication


* * *

## Still Having Issues?

If you continue to experience authentication failures:

  1. **Double-check DNS records:** Use multiple DNS lookup tools to verify all records are correct and propagated
  2. **Review DMARC reports:** Analyze failure patterns to identify specific authentication issues
  3. **Test with different recipients:** Send to Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo to identify provider-specific issues
  4. **Check for conflicting records:** Ensure no duplicate or conflicting SPF/DKIM records exist
