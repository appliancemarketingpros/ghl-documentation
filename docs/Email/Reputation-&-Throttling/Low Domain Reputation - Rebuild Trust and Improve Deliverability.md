## What's Happening?

Your domain has developed a poor reputation with email providers and security services, causing your emails to be blocked, deferred, or sent to spam folders. Domain reputation is like a credit score for your email sending - it's built over time based on your sending practices, recipient engagement, and complaint rates.

When your domain reputation is low, major email providers like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo will automatically reject or quarantine your messages to protect their users from potential spam or malicious content.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying Reputation Issues

Look for these bounce messages that indicate domain reputation problems:

### Gmail Reputation Blocks

  * "The sending domain has a very low reputation, causing Gmail to block the message as potentially suspicious or spam"
  * "The sending domain has a poor reputation, causing Gmail to block or defer messages as potential spam"
  * "The sending domain has a very low reputation, causing Gmail to block the message as suspicious or spam-like"


### General Reputation Issues

  * "The sending domain has a poor reputation, causing the recipient's mail system to reject the message"


### Blacklist-Related Issues

  * "The sending domain is blacklisted by Spamhaus, causing email rejection"
  * "The sending domain is listed on industry blocklists, causing emails to be rejected for potential spam or abuse"
  * "The sending domain is blacklisted by reputation services like Spamhaus or Abusix"


* * *

## Understanding Domain Reputation

### What Affects Domain Reputation?

**Domain Age:** New domains (less than 3 months old) are viewed with suspicion by ISPs and need proper warming up.

**Authentication Status:** Missing or misconfigured SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records severely damage reputation.

**Engagement Metrics:** Low open rates, high bounce rates, and spam complaints directly impact your reputation score.

**Sending Patterns:** Sudden volume spikes, irregular sending schedules, and poor list hygiene harm reputation.

**Content Quality:** Spam-like content, misleading subject lines, and poor formatting trigger reputation penalties.

  


### How Domain Reputation Works

**Think of domain reputation as a credit score that ranges from 0-100:**

  * **85-100:** Excellent reputation - high inbox placement
  * **70-84:** Good reputation - mostly inbox, some promotions tab
  * **50-69:** Fair reputation - mixed inbox/spam placement
  * **Below 50:** Poor reputation - mostly spam folder or blocked


* * *

## Step-by-Step Reputation Recovery

### Step 1: Check Your Domain Authentication Status

  1. Log into your account
  2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Email Services** → Dedicated Domain and IP
  3. Click **Verify Domain** for your domain
  4. Verify all six are properly configured
  5. If any show as failed, follow the DNS setup instructions provided
  6. Wait 2 minutes for DNS propagation


### Step 2: Use External Tools to Monitor Your Reputation

**Essential Reputation Checkers:**

  * **Google Postmaster Tools** \- Set up at `postmaster.google.com`
    * Shows domain reputation, spam rate, and delivery errors for Gmail
    * Provides IP reputation and authentication data
    * Essential since Gmail represents 60%+ of most email lists
  * **Sender Score** \- Free reputation score (0-100)
    * Visit `senderscore.org`
    * Enter your domain to get reputation score
    * Scores below 70 indicate reputation issues


**Blacklist Checker:**

  * **MXToolbox Blacklist Check** \- Comprehensive blacklist monitoring


### Step 3: Analyze Your Current Performance

  1. Go to **Marketing** → **Email** → **Statistics**
  2. Review recent campaign performance:
     * **Delivery Rate:** Should be >95% (if lower, reputation issues likely)
     * **Open Rate:** Should be >20% (if lower, may indicate spam folder placement)
     * **Bounce Rate:** Should be <2% (if higher, list quality issues)
     * **Unsubscribe Rate:** Should be <2% (if higher, content/targeting issues)
  3. **Key indicator:** If delivery rates are dropping but bounce rates aren't increasing, emails are likely going to spam folders due to reputation issues
  4. Go to **Settings → Email Service → Bounce Classification**
  5. Look for patterns in bounce classification - reputation issues will show specific error messages


### Step 4: Perform Inbox Placement Testing

**Since direct reputation scores are harder to get, test actual inbox placement:**

  1. **Manual Seed Testing:**
     * Create test accounts on Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and Apple Mail
     * Send test campaigns to these accounts
     * Check inbox vs. spam folder placement
     * Document placement rates across providers
  2. **Third-party Testing Tools:**
     * Mail-Tester.com - Free spam score testing
     * GlockApps - Inbox placement testing
     * EmailOnAcid - Deliverability testing
     * 250ok (now Validity) - Professional deliverability monitoring


### Step 5: Check and Remove Blacklist Listings

  1. Use the blacklist checkers mentioned above to identify any listings
  2. For each blacklist where you're listed, visit their removal page
  3. Submit delisting requests with:
     * Your domain name
     * Explanation of issue resolution
     * Steps taken to prevent recurrence
  4. Monitor removal status daily (can take 24 hours to 7 days)


### Step 6: Clean Your Email Lists Aggressively

**Remove problematic contacts:**

  1. Go to **Contacts**
  2. Create filters to identify and remove:
     * **Hard bounces** \- Filter by **Valid Email** is **Invalid**
     * **Unengaged contacts** \- No opens/clicks in 90+ days
       * **Last Email Opened Date - More than - 90 days ago**
       * **Last Email Clicked Date**\- More than - 90 days ago****
     * **Role-based emails** \- info@, admin@, noreply@ addresses
  3. **Suppress or delete** these contacts from future campaigns
  4. Focus on **engaged, opted-in subscribers only**


### Step 7: Implement Domain Warm-up Strategy

**Start with minimal sending volumes:**

  1. Control your sending volume
  2. Follow this gradual increase schedule:![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155057622696/original/Ourk8oTy8NxHcbyPpgecGt1kVvAj1jRoiw.png?1762342316)
  3. **Send to your most engaged subscribers first**
  4. Monitor external reputation tools and inbox placement daily
  5. Only increase volume if engagement remains high (>20% open rate)


### Step 8: Optimize Email Content and Practices

**Review and improve recent campaigns:**

  1. Go to ****Marketing** → **Email** → **Statistics****
  2. Identify campaigns with poor performance and improve:
     * Remove spam trigger words ("Free," "Guaranteed," "Act Now," "Limited Time")
     * Ensure clear sender identification
     * Include physical address and easy unsubscribe
     * Use personalization and relevant content
     * Maintain consistent sender name and "From" address
     * Include both HTML and plain text versions

**Remember:** With Google Postmaster Tools no longer showing direct reputation scores, GoHighLevel users must rely more heavily on performance metrics. Focus on consistent engagement metrics and delivery performance as your primary indicators of reputation health.

Domain reputation recovery takes 30-90 days of consistent good practices, but monitoring has become more challenging. The key is to use multiple data sources and focus on actual inbox placement rather than just reputation scores.
