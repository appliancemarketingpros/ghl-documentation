# Rate Limited/Throttled Email Delivery: Complete Resolution Guide

## What's Happening?

Your emails are being temporarily delayed or rejected because recipient servers are limiting the rate at which they accept messages from your sending domain or IP address. This is a protective measure that email providers use to prevent spam and manage server load, but it can affect legitimate senders when volume spikes or reputation drops.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying Rate Limiting Issues

### Common Rate Limiting Bounce Messages

  * "The recipient's server is temporarily limiting or delaying incoming messages due to high volume or policy"
  * "The sending server is temporarily restricted due to high volume or low reputation"
  * "The recipient is receiving too many emails too quickly, so further messages are temporarily blocked"
  * "Yahoo is temporarily deferring messages due to high volume or user complaints"
  * "The recipient's mailbox has reached its hourly message receiving limit"
  * "The receiving server delayed or rejected the message due to too many delivery attempts"
  * "The recipient server is temporarily limiting or rejecting messages due to high sending volume"
  * "The sending server is temporarily deferring messages due to high volume or user complaints"


* * *

## Understanding Rate Limiting and Throttling

### Key Concepts

**Rate Limiting Fundamentals:**

  * **Temporary Protection:** Rate limits are usually temporary restrictions, not permanent blocks
  * **Volume-Based:** Triggered when you send too many emails too quickly to the same provider
  * **Reputation-Influenced:** Lower sender reputation leads to stricter rate limits
  * **Provider-Specific:** Each email provider (Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) has different thresholds
  * **Recoverable:** Most rate limiting resolves within hours to days with proper adjustments
  * **Auto-Handled Bounces:** Our platform automatically marks invalid addresses, helping maintain list quality


### Rate Limiting Categories

Volume-Based Throttling:

  * Too many emails sent in a short time period
  * Exceeding hourly or daily sending limits
  * Sudden spikes in sending volume


Reputation-Based Restrictions:

  * Low sender score triggering conservative limits
  * Recent complaint or bounce rate increases
  * New sending domain with limited history


Recipient-Level Limits:

  * Individual mailbox receiving limits exceeded
  * Domain-wide incoming message restrictions


* * *

## Step-by-Step Rate Limiting Resolution

### Step 1: Implement Batch Sending Strategy

**Use batch sending feature to control email volume:**

  1. **Access Campaign Creation:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Campaigns** → **Create Campaign**
     * Select **Email Campaign** type
     * Choose your email template and audience
  2. **Configure Batch Sending:**
     * In the campaign setup, look for **Scheduling Options**
     * Select **Batch Sending** or **Schedule in Batches**
     * Set conservative batch sizes: Start with 50-100 emails per batch
     * Space batches 2-4 hours apart initially
  3. **Pause Existing High-Volume Campaigns:**
     * Navigate to active campaigns and pause any sending large volumes
     * Convert them to batch sending format
     * Prioritize essential communications only


#### Batch Sending Success Indicators

  * Fewer bounce messages mentioning "high volume" or "too quickly"
  * Improved delivery rates within each batch
  * Emails processing smoothly without immediate rejections

### Step 2: Monitor External Reputation Metrics

**Since our patform doesn't provide built-in reputation monitoring, use these external tools:**

  1. **Check Sender Score:**
     * Visit **senderscore.org**
     * Enter your sending domain or IP address
     * Score below 70 indicates reputation issues contributing to rate limiting
  2. **Verify IP Reputation:**
     * Use **mxtoolbox.com/blacklists.aspx**
     * Check if your sending IP appears on any blacklists
     * Monitor for "policy" or "reputation" related listings
  3. **Provider-Specific Tools:**
     * **Gmail:** Check Google Postmaster Tools for reputation data
     * **Microsoft:** Review Smart Network Data Services (SNDS)
     * **Yahoo:** Monitor Yahoo Sender Hub feedback


### Step 3: Leverage Automatic Bounce Handling

**Our platform automatically manages bounced addresses to improve your sender reputation:**

  1. **Review Bounce Reports:**
     * Go to **Marketing** → **Email** → **Reports**
     * Check bounce rates and types in your recent campaigns
     * Note that hard bounces are automatically marked as invalid
  2. **Verify Invalid Contact Management:**
     * Navigate to **Contacts** → **All Contacts**
     * Filter by **Invalid** or **Bounced** status
     * Confirm these contacts are excluded from future campaigns
  3. **Focus on Engaged Segments:**
     * Go to **Contacts** → **Smart Lists**
     * Create segments based on recent email engagement
     * Prioritize batch sending to your most engaged contacts first


### Step 4: Verify Sending Domain Authentication

**Ensure proper domain authentication to improve reputation:**

  1. **Check Domain Settings:**
     * Go to **Settings** → **Email Services** → **Sending Domain**
     * Confirm SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records show as verified
     * Look for green checkmarks or "Verified" status
  2. **Update DNS Records if Needed:**
     * Copy any unverified DNS records
     * Add them to your domain's DNS settings
     * Wait 24-48 hours for propagation and re-verification


* * *

## Recovery Timeline and Expectations

### Phase 1: Immediate Relief (2-6 hours)

  * **Action:** Switch to batch sending with conservative volumes
  * **Expected outcome:** Reduced bounce rates, fewer "too quickly" messages
  * **Success metric:** 50% reduction in rate limiting bounces


### Phase 2: Short-term Stabilization (1-3 days)

  * **Action:** Gradually increase batch sizes with engaged contacts
  * **Expected outcome:** Consistent delivery within each batch
  * **Success metric:** 80%+ delivery rate to high-engagement segments


### Phase 3: Full Recovery (1-2 weeks)

  * **Action:** Return to larger batch sizes with reputation monitoring
  * **Expected outcome:** Normal delivery rates across all segments
  * **Success metric:** Less than 2% rate limiting bounces

## Prevention Best Practices

### Smart Batch Management

  * **Conservative Start:** Begin with small batches (50-100 emails) and increase gradually
  * **Consistent Timing:** Space batches evenly throughout business hours
  * **Provider Awareness:** Consider smaller batches for strict providers like Yahoo
  * **Engagement Priority:** Send to most engaged contacts first in each batch


### Ongoing Reputation Maintenance

  * **Weekly Monitoring:** Check sender score and blacklist status weekly
  * **Bounce Rate Tracking:** Monitor bounce rates in campaign reports
  * **Trust our System:** Let automatic bounce handling maintain list quality
  * **Content Quality:** Avoid spam trigger words and maintain professional formatting


* * *

## Still Having Issues?

If you continue to experience rate limiting challenges after implementing batch sending:

  1. **Reduce Batch Sizes Further:** Try 25-50 emails per batch with longer intervals
  2. **Segment by Provider:** Create separate batches for Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook recipients
  3. **Review Content:** Analyze email content for elements that might trigger aggressive filtering
  4. **Consider Timing:** Avoid peak sending times when providers are most restrictive
