# Fixing Low IP Reputation Issues - Restore Sending IP Credibility

## What's Happening?

Your sending IP address has developed a poor reputation with email providers and security services, causing your emails to be blocked or rejected. Unlike domain reputation, IP reputation is tied to the specific server or infrastructure sending your emails. In Our platform, this means the IP infrastructure you're using needs reputation recovery through improved sending practices and proper list management.

IP reputation issues are often more immediate than domain reputation problems, as they can result in complete blocking rather than just spam folder placement. The good news is that IP reputation can be restored more quickly than domain reputation with the right approach.

## Quick Diagnosis: Identifying IP Reputation Issues

Look for these bounce messages that indicate IP reputation problems:

### Outlook/Microsoft Blocks

  * "The sending server's IP address is on a block list, causing Outlook to reject the message"
  * "The sending server's IP is blocked due to poor reputation or suspicious activity"
  * "The sending server's IP address is blocked or refused due to a history of abuse or suspicious activity"


### General IP Reputation Issues

  * "The sending server's IP is blocked or blacklisted due to poor reputation or spam reports"
  * "The sending server's IP address has a poor reputation, causing the recipient to reject the message"
  * "The sending server's IP has a history of violating recipient policies, leading to mail being blocked"


### Blacklist-Related IP Issues

  * "The sending server's IP is on a blocklist, causing rejection by the recipient's email provider"
  * "The sending server's IP address is listed on one or more DNS-based blacklists"
  * "The sending IP is listed on a reputation blocklist, causing the recipient server to reject the message"
  * "The sending IP or domain is listed on public blocklists due to suspected spam or abuse"
  * "The sending server's IP is blacklisted, causing email rejection"


* * *

## Understanding IP Infrastructure

### Dedicated IP Setup

### Key Differences: IP vs Domain Reputation

IP Reputation:

  * **Where:** Tied to the server/infrastructure sending emails
  * **Management:** Professionally managed by us (shared IP)
  * **Recovery:** Can be restored relatively quickly with proper practices
  * **Impact:** More immediate - affects delivery speed


Domain Reputation:

  * **Who:** Tied to your specific sending domain
  * **Control:** Under your direct control
  * **Portability:** Follows you regardless of ESP changes
  * **Impact:** Long-term factor in inbox placement


* * *

## Step-by-Step IP Reputation Recovery

### Step 1: Identify Your IP Setup

**Check your IP configuration:**

  1. **Navigate to Email Services:**
     * Go to **Settings** → **Email Services**
     * Check if you have access to **Postmaster Tools** tab
     * Look for **Microsoft SNDS** section
  2. **Determine your IP type:**
     * **If you see SNDS data:** You have a dedicated IP
     * **If you see "IP not found in your account":** You're on shared IP (which is perfectly fine!)
  3. **For email header checking (if needed):**
     * Send a test email to yourself
     * View email source to see sending IP in headers
     * Look for: `Authentication-Results: spf=pass (sender IP is [IP])`


### Step 2: IP Reputation Assessment Based on Your Setup
