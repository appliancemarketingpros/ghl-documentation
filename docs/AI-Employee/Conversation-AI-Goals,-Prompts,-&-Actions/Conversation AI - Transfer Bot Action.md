## **Transfer to Live Chat**

  


**Send the user to a human agent when automated help isn’t enough.**

  


Selecting this option moves the conversation from the bot to a human representative via the **Live Chat** interface. The chat appears in the **Conversations tab** , allowing the agent to respond manually in real-time.

  


**Use Case Example:** A user requests billing help, and the bot triggers a transfer to the billing team via live chat.

  


## **Transfer to Another Bot**

  


**Use this when you want to divide responsibilities between multiple bots.**

  


This allows you to direct the user to another bot—ideal for splitting up topics (sales vs. support) or handling multiple languages. Choose from any of your published bots.

  


**Pro Tip:** Make sure the destination bot is published and tested to prevent dead ends.

  


## **Transfer to Workflow**

  


**Trigger powerful automation flows when the bot needs to hand off tasks.**

  


When selected, this option initiates a **Workflow** tied to the user’s current context. This is perfect for automating post-chat actions like:

  * Booking appointments

  * Sending follow-up emails

  * Updating contact records

  * Triggering internal alerts


  


## **Transfer to Agent**

  


**Assign the conversation directly to a specific user or team.**

  


Choose a designated **agent or user group** so conversations are routed precisely. This is useful for tier-based support, regional teams, or individual reps.

  


You can optionally apply filters like “agent online only” or set fallback agents.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: What happens if no one is available in live chat?**

If no agent is online, the transfer can be configured to fall back to another bot step, leave a message, or retry after a delay.

  


**Q: Can I delay the transfer?**

Yes. Insert a **Wait Step** before the transfer step to delay it for a set amount of time.

  


**Q: Will chat history be preserved after transfer?**

Yes, the full conversation transcript is retained and visible to both bots and agents.

  


**Q: Can I use conditions to control transfers?**

Absolutely. Use a **Condition Step** before the Transfer step to only trigger it based on tags, responses, or contact attributes.

  


**Q: Is the Transfer Bot Action available in all plans?**

Yes, but access to certain destinations like Workflows or Live Chat may depend on plan-level feature availability.
