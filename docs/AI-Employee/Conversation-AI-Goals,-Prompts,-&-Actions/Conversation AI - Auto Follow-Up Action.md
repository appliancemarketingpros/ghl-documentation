# **What is Auto Follow-Up in Conversation AI?**

  


Auto Follow-Up is an intelligent automation tool within HighLevel’s Conversation AI that detects when a contact drops off, becomes inactive, or requests a future follow-up, and then schedules and sends follow-up messages automatically. By leveraging AI, the system recognizes common drop-off scenarios—such as a user saying they’re busy, asking for a specific follow-up time, or simply not replying—and ensures that your leads remain engaged without requiring manual intervention.

## **Key Benefits of Auto Follow-Up Action in Conversation AI**

  * **Reduces manual workload:** Automates follow-up messages so your team spends less time on repetitive outreach.  
  


  * **Boosts engagement:** Sends timely, personalized follow-ups that keep conversations moving forward.  
  


  * **Minimizes lead leakage:** Ensures every contact gets a follow-up so no lead is missed or forgotten.  
  


  * **Supports custom messaging:** Lets you use AI-generated follow-ups or write and control the message yourself.  
  


  * **Integrates with workflows:** Triggers actions like tagging contacts, assigning conversations, or notifying users automatically.  
  


  * **Respects business hours:** Only sends follow-ups during the working hours you define.  
  


  * **Switches channels dynamically:** Moves between channels (like Live Chat to SMS) to improve deliverability and reach.  
  


  * **Provides full visibility:** Shows all scheduled follow-ups in the Response Info panel so you can track what’s happening.  
  


  * **Language-adherent follow-ups:** If a contact has a preferred language set, scheduled follow-ups send in that language automatically. No extra setup is required.

### **_Step 4:_**_Follow-Up Settings_

  


To improve engagement and respect timing preferences, configure these advanced options:

####   


#### **A. Set Follow-Up Working Hours**

####   

    
    
    **Note:** This setting **ONLY** applies to follow-up messages, not to the main AI agent conversations.

  


  1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**  
  


  2. Enable **Set Active Hours for Followup** toggle.  
  
![](https://jumpshare.com/share/BxANjXyotzwjRxtbhdUD+/Screen+Shot+2026-01-19+at+7.01.58+PM.png)  
  


  3. **Choose** **Timezone** : **Contact** or **Business** Timezone.

Follow-ups will only be sent during the active hours specified below, based on the selected timezone. If we don't find contact timezone, we will honour business timezone.

  4. Set the specific **Active** **Hours** when follow-up messages should be sent (e.g., 9 AM – 6 PM).  
  


  5. If disabled, messages will be sent **regardless of time**.  
  


  6. Click on **Save**.

#### **B. Enable Dynamic Channel Switching**

  


  1. Click on **Follow-Up Settings.**  
  


  2. Enable **Dynamic Channel Switching.**  
  


  3. This allows the AI to automatically switch to another available channel if the original one becomes inactive.  
  


     * For example, if the contact doesn’t respond on Live Chat, the bot may follow up via **SMS** , **Facebook Messenger** , **Instagram** , or **WhatsApp** , depending on available channels.  
  


  4. Click on **Save**.

## **Smart Detection of Drop-Off Scenarios**

  


Auto Follow-Up **evaluates the conversation context before sending a scheduled message**. If the conversation appears closed or follow-up is no longer appropriate, the system skips or cancels the follow-up automatically. (**No additional setup required**.)

  


Auto Follow-Up is suppressed when the contact:

  


  * Is **disqualified** (for example, out of service area).  
  

  * Shows **disinterest** or **opts** **out** (for example, “Not interested,” “Stop texting me”).  
  

  * Responds with **anger** or **frustration** (for example, “Leave me alone,” “This is spam”).  
  

  * Ends the conversation with a **soft** **closure** that signals completion (for example, “Thanks for the chat,” “Let me know if you need anything else”).


* * *

## **Dynamic Channel Switching**

  


To maximize engagement, Auto Follow-Up can switch channels if a contact is unresponsive, helping you reach contacts where they’re most likely to reply.

  * Switches from Live Chat to SMS if chat is inactive and a phone number is available.  
  

  * On platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp, switches to SMS if no response within 24 hours.  
  

  * This feature is optional and can be disabled.


* * *

## **Full Visibility in AI Response Info**

  


All scheduled follow-ups are displayed in the Response Info panel, giving you complete transparency and control over your automated outreach.

  


  * Easily track which follow-ups are pending and why.  
  

  * Maintain oversight of all automated communication.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Why didn’t Auto Follow-Up send a message I scheduled?**

Auto Follow-Up may skip or cancel a scheduled message if the conversation context indicates follow-up is not appropriate (for example, the contact opted out, showed disinterest, was disqualified, or the conversation ended naturally).

  


**Q: What happens if a contact replies before the scheduled follow-up?**

The follow-up schedule is automatically reset and no further follow-up messages are sent for that conversation.

  


**Q:What are timezone-aware follow-ups?**

Timezone-aware follow-ups let you decide whether Auto Follow-Up messages should be sent based on your business timezone or the contact’s local timezone.

  


**Q: What’s the difference between Business Timezone and Contact Timezone?**

  * **Business Timezone:** Follow-ups follow the working hours defined for your business location.
  * **Contact Timezone:** Follow-ups are scheduled using the contact’s local time (when available), so they receive messages during their working hours.


  


**Q: How do working hours apply when timezone awareness is enabled?**

Follow-ups are only sent during the active hours you set (for example, 9 AM–5 PM). Those hours are applied based on whichever timezone you select: Contact or Business.

  


**Q: What happens if a contact’s timezone isn’t available?**

If we can’t detect or find a contact’s timezone, the system will default to your Business Timezone and honor your business working hours.

  


**Q: Can I customize the follow-up messages sent by the bot?**

Yes, you can use AI-generated messages or write your own custom follow-up messages.

  


**Q: What channels does Auto Follow-Up support for messaging?**

Auto Follow-Up works across Live Chat, SMS, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, with dynamic channel switching available as needed.

  


**Q: How do I prevent my contacts from being overwhelmed by follow-ups?**

Use realistic delay intervals and avoid sending too many follow-ups in a short period to maintain a positive user experience.

  


**Q: Where can I see all scheduled follow-ups?**

All scheduled follow-ups are visible in the Response Info panel for full transparency.

  


**Q: What happens if the bot is inactive?**

No follow-up messages will be sent if the bot is inactive.

  


**Q: Do follow-up messages match the contact’s language?****  
**Yes. If a contact has a preferred language set, Conversation AI sends follow-ups in that language by default.
