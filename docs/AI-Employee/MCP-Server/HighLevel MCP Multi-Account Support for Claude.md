## What is HighLevel MCP for Claude?

The HighLevel Model Context Protocol (MCP) server is an integration that allows Claude AI assistants to interact directly with your HighLevel CRM data and operations. MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models.

The Anthropic-specific endpoint _(`https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/anthropic/v2`) _provides Claude with a standardized way to query, automate, and orchestrate everything in your HighLevel account through natural language commands — without you or the model needing to know the internal API details.

This endpoint works with Claude.ai, Claude Code (CLI), and Claude Cowork, giving you flexibility across different Claude environments.

## Key Benefits

The multi-account MCP endpoint transforms how agencies manage their HighLevel sub-accounts through Claude AI.

**One Connection for Multiple Sub-Accounts** — Agencies connect once and select which sub-accounts to authorize, eliminating the need for separate connections per location.

**Instant Sub-Account Switching** — Work across different locations in the same conversation by simply naming the sub-account in your request.

**Natural Language Automation** — Issue complex commands in plain English without knowing API syntax or operation names.

**Comprehensive Coverage** — Access 625 operations across 40 product domains, filtered by your OAuth permissions.

**Unified Tool Interface** — Six consistent tools handle discovery, inspection, and execution of all operations without overwhelming the model's context.

**Security by Design** — Every request is scoped to one sub-account, authorized against your installation, and executed with short-lived tokens.

## Multi-Account Connection Overview

The Anthropic MCP endpoint supports both individual and agency-level connections, each optimized for different use cases.

Connection Type 1

Individual User (Single Sub-Account)

When connecting as an individual user, you authorize Claude to access a single sub-account. This is the default connection mode and works identically to previous MCP implementations — the connection remains tied to that one location for its lifetime.

Connection Type 2

Agency (Multiple Sub-Accounts)

Agency installations allow you to select multiple sub-accounts during the authorization flow. You can choose one sub-account, several specific locations, or all available sub-accounts under your agency. Claude can then work across only those authorized locations in the same conversation, switching between them as you direct.

How It Works

During installation, agencies choose which sub-accounts to include. The connection then operates on exactly those sub-accounts and no others. Each request runs against a single sub-account — either the one you name in your prompt, or one Claude identifies through the `list_locations` tool when the context is ambiguous.

4

## Available MCP Tools

Rather than exposing hundreds of individual operations as separate tools, the MCP server provides six unified tools that Claude uses to discover, inspect, and execute the full operation catalog. This compact toolset prevents overwhelming the model's context window while maintaining access to the entire HighLevel API surface.

Tool 1

search

Finds customer or business records by name, email, phone, tag, or similar criteria. This is typically the first tool Claude calls when you ask about existing data.

Tool 2

fetch

Retrieves the full details of one or more records returned by `search`. Use this to get complete information about a contact, opportunity, or other entity.

Tool 3

search_operations

Discovers available operations by intent (list, create, update, delete, etc.). Claude calls this to find which operations match your request before executing anything.

Tool 4

describe_operation

Inspects an operation's required and optional inputs before running it. This ensures Claude knows what data to pass and in what format.

Tool 5

execute_operation

Runs one operation against the HighLevel API, subject to your OAuth scopes and built-in safety checks. All create, update, and delete actions flow through this tool.

Tool 6

list_locations

Lists the sub-accounts this connection can access. Claude calls this when the target sub-account is ambiguous or when you ask to see available locations. For single-location connections, this simply returns the one authorized sub-account.

Example in Action

When you ask Claude to "Find the contact with email jane@example.com, add the tag 'vip-2026', and create a new opportunity worth $5,000," Claude uses `search` to find Jane, `search_operations` to discover the tag and opportunity operations, `describe_operation` to inspect their inputs, and `execute_operation` twice to complete both actions. You receive a single confirmation message.

Powerful Integration

625 Operations Across 40 Domains

The MCP endpoint provides comprehensive access to your entire HighLevel platform through Claude's natural language interface.

## Authentication Methods

The MCP endpoint supports two authentication methods. OAuth is recommended because it exposes a broader set of scopes and operations than Private Integration Tokens.

Method 1

OAuth (Recommended)

One-click sign-in through the HighLevel consent flow. When you authorize the connection, you review and approve the scopes on the consent screen. OAuth requires no manual token storage or rotation and provides access to the widest set of scopes.

You can review or revoke OAuth access at any time from your HighLevel account settings.

Method 2

Private Integration Token (PIT)

Create a token under Settings → Private Integrations, selecting the scopes you want the token to have. Pass the token in the Authorization header (`Bearer pit-your-token`) when connecting your MCP client.

A PIT offers a more limited set of scopes compared to OAuth, which may restrict the operations Claude can perform.

Scope Filtering

In both authentication methods, you choose which scopes to grant the integration. The operations Claude can perform are filtered by these scopes — the assistant can only access data and features your authorization permits.

## How to Connect Claude Clients

The HighLevel MCP endpoint works with three Claude environments. Follow the setup instructions for your client below.

Client 1

Claude.ai

  1. Open [Claude.ai](<https://claude.ai>) and navigate to Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector.
  2. Set the server URL to `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/anthropic/v2`.
  3. Click Connect and complete the HighLevel sign-in flow (sign in → pick sub-account(s) → approve scopes).
  4. Start a new chat. The HighLevel MCP tools are now available.
  5. Test the connection by asking: "Find the last 5 contacts I added in HighLevel."


Client 2

Claude Code (CLI)

Run this command in your terminal:

`claude mcp add --transport http leadconnector https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/anthropic/v2`

Alternatively, add it to `.mcp.json` at your project root:
    
    
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "leadconnector": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/anthropic/v2"
        }
      }
    }

On first use, Claude Code opens a browser for HighLevel authorization. Verify the connection with `claude mcp list`.

Client 3

Claude Cowork

  1. In Claude Cowork, open the connectors / integrations settings.
  2. Choose Add custom connector.
  3. Set the server URL to `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/anthropic/v2`.
  4. Complete the HighLevel sign-in flow (sign in → pick sub-account(s) → approve).


Your Cowork agents can now use the HighLevel MCP tools.

Private Integration Token Alternative

Instead of OAuth, you can pass a Private Integration Token in the Authorization header (`Bearer pit-your-token`). Create the token under Settings → Private Integrations and select the desired scopes before connecting.

7

## Switching Between Sub-Accounts

For agency connections authorized to access multiple sub-accounts, Claude can switch between locations instantly within the same conversation. Simply mention the sub-account name in your request.

Example Workflow

You: "Show me the latest opportunities in Downtown Clinic."

Claude retrieves and displays the opportunities for Downtown Clinic.

You: "Now create a contact in Westside Dental."

Claude switches to Westside Dental and creates the contact — no reconnection required.

When the target sub-account is unclear or not mentioned, Claude calls the `list_locations` tool to show available locations and asks you to choose. This ensures operations always execute against the correct sub-account.

Single Sub-Account Connections

If you connected to only one sub-account (the default for individual users), `list_locations` simply returns that location. You don't need to name the sub-account in your requests — Claude always knows which one to use.

8

## Security & Permissions

The MCP endpoint implements multiple security layers to ensure your HighLevel data remains protected.

**Sub-Account Selection at Install** — You choose exactly which sub-accounts the connection can access during the authorization flow. The connection can never reach locations you didn't include.

**Single Sub-Account Per Request** — Every operation executes against one sub-account at a time, even with an agency-level connection. Cross-location operations are not possible.

**Scope-Based Authorization** — Operations are filtered by the OAuth scopes or Private Integration Token scopes you granted. Claude can only perform actions your authorization permits.

**Short-Lived Location Tokens** — Each request is executed using a temporary token scoped to the target sub-account, minimizing the impact of token exposure.

**Safety Checks on Sensitive Operations** — Irreversible and destructive operations are gated with additional confirmation prompts and safety checks before execution.

**Revocable Access** — You can review, modify, or revoke OAuth access at any time from your HighLevel account settings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What is the difference between the /mcp/anthropic/v2 endpoint and the original /mcp/ endpoint?

The `/mcp/anthropic/v2` endpoint is Claude-specific and provides the full operation catalog (625 operations across 40 domains) plus multi-sub-account support for agencies. The original `/mcp/` endpoint works with any HTTP-based MCP client but offers a more limited, focused set of core tools and supports only one sub-account per connection.

Q: Can I connect to multiple sub-accounts at once?

Yes, if you are installing as an agency. During the authorization flow, you can select one sub-account, several specific sub-accounts, or all available sub-accounts. The connection can then work across those locations. Each request still executes against a single sub-account at a time.

Q: How does Claude know which sub-account to use when I don't specify one?

If the target sub-account is unclear or not mentioned in your request, Claude calls the `list_locations` tool to retrieve available locations and asks you to choose. For single-sub-account connections, this step is automatic — Claude always knows the one location to use.

Q: Should I use OAuth or a Private Integration Token?

OAuth is recommended. It provides one-click authorization, exposes a broader set of scopes than a Private Integration Token, and requires no manual token storage or rotation. Private Integration Tokens are useful if you prefer header-based authentication or need programmatic control, but they offer a more limited scope set.

Q: Can Claude access sub-accounts I didn't authorize during installation?

No. The connection can only access sub-accounts you selected during the authorization flow. Requests for unauthorized sub-accounts are refused. You must reinstall or re-authorize the connection to grant access to additional locations.
