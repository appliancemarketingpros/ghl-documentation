This article explains how to create a snapshot of fully configured Conversation AI bots in HighLevel, including bot prompts, actions, settings, and training data. Bot snapshots help you quickly deploy the same Conversation AI setup across multiple sub-accounts while keeping configurations consistent. This reduces manual setup time and helps agencies scale proven bot templates with less repetitive work.

## **What is the Conversation AI Bot Snapshot Feature?**  
  


Conversation AI Bot Snapshots allow you to save configured Conversation AI bots into an account snapshot so they can be reused in other sub-accounts. This is useful when you have a tested bot setup that you want to deploy repeatedly without rebuilding prompts, actions, training data, and bot settings from scratch.

The Conversation AI Bot Snapshot feature lets you clone entire bots, including prompts, actions, configurations, Bot Training Web Crawler URLs, and Custom Bot Responses. This helps maintain consistency across client accounts and ensures each imported bot starts with the same structure, logic, and training setup as the original bot.

## **Conversation AI Snapshot Options & Behaviors**  
  


Understanding how Conversation AI bot data is copied helps prevent confusion when importing snapshots into other sub-accounts. These behaviors determine how bots are assigned, what information is included, and how conflicts are handled during import.  
  


### **Primary Bot Auto-Assignment**  
  


If the destination sub-account does not already have a primary Conversation AI bot, the imported bot from the snapshot is automatically set as the primary bot. If a primary bot already exists, you can manually review and update the primary bot setting after import.  
  


### **Conflict Handling**  
  


If a bot with the same name already exists in the destination sub-account, HighLevel provides options during import so you can decide how to handle the conflict.  
  


  * **Overwrite:** Replaces the existing bot with the bot from the snapshot.  
  

  * **Skip:** Keeps the existing bot and does not import the matching bot from the snapshot.  
  


### **What’s Included in the Snapshot?**  
  


Conversation AI bot snapshots are designed to preserve the core bot setup needed to recreate the bot in another sub-account.  
  


Included items may include:  
  


  * Complete bot structure  
  

  * Bot actions  
  

  * Prompt and response mappings  
  

  * Bot settings and configurations  
  

  * Bot Training Web Crawler URLs  
  

  * Custom Bot Responses/FAQs created in Bot Training
