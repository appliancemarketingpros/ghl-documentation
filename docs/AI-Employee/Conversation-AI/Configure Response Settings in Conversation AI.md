# **What is Response Style Settings?**

  
Response Style Settings allow you to set a preferred reply length for a Conversation AI bot. Choosing a response style helps keep responses aligned with your use case: whether you need quick confirmations, helpful context, or more thorough answers without rewriting prompts or rebuilding flows.

Controlling response length helps you deliver a more consistent experience across channels and use cases. The right level of detail can reduce confusion, improve engagement, and keep conversations aligned with your brand.  
  


  * **Channel-friendly replies:** Match reply length to SMS, web chat, social DMs, and more.  
  


  * **Better customer clarity:** Provide the right amount of detail to reduce back-and-forth questions.  
  


  * **Consistent brand experience:** Keep replies aligned with your preferred tone and depth.  
  


  * **Flexible by bot:** Use different styles for different bots based on their purpose.  
  


  * **Easy adjustments:** Switch styles anytime without changing existing flows or prompts.

## **Enable or Disable Response Style Settings  
**

  
Turning Response Style Settings on or off gives you control over whether a bot should follow a selected verbosity style. This is helpful when testing new behavior or returning a bot to its current/default response behavior.  
  


  * **When enabled:** A Response Settings section appears in Bot Settings, allowing you to choose **Concise** , **Balanced** , or **Detailed**.  
  


  * **When disabled:** The bot continues responding exactly as it does today (without applying a selected response style).  
  


Response Style| Approximate Length| Best For| What to Expect  
---|---|---|---  
Concise| ~30 words| Quick acknowledgments, simple Q&A, SMS-friendly replies| Direct answers with minimal extra context  
Balanced| ~80 words| Most general conversations, qualifying questions, basic support| Clear answer plus light context or guidance  
Detailed| ~200 words| FAQs, troubleshooting, onboarding, step-by-step instructions| More thorough, structured explanations  
  
  

    
    
    **Note:** Response Style word counts are **guidelines, not strict caps**. Depending on the conversation, replies may be slightly shorter or longer than the target length. 
    If your prompt includes **conflicting length instructions** (example: “always respond in 20 words”), results may be less predictable. For **best results** , avoid adding separate word-count rules inside your custom prompt when using Response Style Settings.

* * *

## **Bot-Level Configuration**

  
Bot-level settings make it easier to tailor different experiences across channels and purposes. This is especially useful if you run separate bots for sales, support, or different platforms.  
  


Response Style Settings apply to the **current bot only** , which means you can:

  * Run one bot in **Concise** mode for SMS

  * Run another bot in **Detailed** mode for support-heavy channels (like web chat or Messenger)

## **How To Setup Response Style Settings**

  
Correct setup ensures the bot consistently follows your chosen verbosity level. Once enabled, the selected style applies to new replies automatically, making it easy to standardize response length without redesigning your bot.
