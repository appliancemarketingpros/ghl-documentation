# **What is Email Forwarding in Conversations?****  
**

  
Email Forwarding lets an agent take a specific inbound email inside a Conversation and send it to external recipients from within HighLevel. The forwarded message preserves the original email content and formatting so stakeholders outside your account can review context without you switching tools.  
  


  * Forward any inbound email message to external recipients right from the thread.  
  

  * Preserve original content and layout for context continuity.  
  

  * Keep the full history inside the same Conversation for auditability.


* * *

## **Key Benefits of Email Forwarding**

**  
**

Understanding the benefits helps teams decide when to use forwarding instead of copy‑pasting or switching to a separate inbox. These advantages reduce handoff friction and keep records centralized.  
  


  * **Single Workspace:** Maintain Conversations as the single source of truth for email threads and actions.  
  

  * **Faster Escalations:** Route messages to reviewers or third parties in a few clicks—no app switching.  
  

  * **Consistency:** Preserve original formatting so stakeholders see exactly what the customer sent.  
  

  * **Traceability:** Keep a forward event and message copy in the Conversation timeline for team visibility.  
  

  * **Focus:** Reduce context loss and human error compared with manual copy/paste workflows.


* * *

## **Permissions & Availability**

  


Before forwarding, ensure the right users have access and that the email channel is correctly connected. Proper prerequisites prevent missing buttons or delivery failures later.  
  


  * An active email channel must be connected to the sub‑account (e.g., LC Email, Gmail via 2‑way sync, Outlook via 2‑way sync, or SMTP).  
  

  * Users must have access to Conversations and permission to send emails.  
  

  * Mobile availability may vary; if you don’t see Forward, use the web app.  
  

  * Forwarding uses your account’s configured sending mailbox and routing rules.  
  


* * *

## **Sender & From‑Name Behavior**

  


Knowing which sender address and display name are used helps you meet brand guidelines and set recipient expectations. Use this section to understand current behavior and upcoming enhancements.  
  


  * Forwards are sent using the sending mailbox associated with the Conversation’s email channel and your sending priority rules.  
  

  * The From name follows current account rules. From‑name editability for forwards is planned as an enhancement.  
  

  * Recipients see the sender per your existing Sending Priority configuration.


* * *

## **Attachments & Formatting****  
**

  


Forwards often include screenshots, PDFs, or inline images. Understanding how the system handles formatting and files reduces resend attempts and confusion for recipients.  
  


  * The forwarded email preserves original content and formatting for clarity.  
  

  * Inline images and signatures are included when supported by the source and provider.  
  

  * Attachments from the original email are included when supported; extremely large files or blocked types may be excluded by your provider or security settings.  
  

  * Provider and domain policies (e.g., size limits, file‑type restrictions) still apply.


* * *

## **Threading & Record‑Keeping**

  


Maintaining a complete history inside the Conversation helps teams collaborate and comply with audits. This section clarifies how a forward shows in the timeline and how it relates to the original message.  
  


  * The forward appears in the same Conversation as an outbound email event so teammates can see context.  
  

  * The timeline shows who forwarded, when, and the recipients (redacted where appropriate).  
  

  * Replies to the forwarded message route back to your connected mailbox and appear in the Conversation if syncing is enabled.

## **How To Set Up and Use Email Forwarding**

  
A clean setup and a consistent workflow ensure your forwards deliver successfully and remain linked to the right records. Follow these steps to configure, verify, and send your first forward.

  


  1. Go to Conversations and open a thread that contains an inbound email you want to forward.

  2. Click on the Kebab icon and locate the Forward action (usually in the message actions or overflow menu).

  3. In the Forward composer, add recipient email addresses in To. Optionally add CC/BCC if available.

  4. Review the Subject (prefixed with Fwd: by default) and edit the message body as needed.

  5. Confirm attachments/inline images you want to include are present.

  6. Click Send. The forwarded message posts to the conversation timeline.

## **Troubleshooting  
**

  
If forwarding fails or behaves unexpectedly, use these checks to isolate configuration issues, provider limits, or permission constraints quickly.  
  


  * Can’t see the Forward Option: Ensure you’re viewing an email message (not SMS or social) and you have send permissions. Verify the account has an email channel connected.  
  

  * Bounces or Delivery Errors: Review the error banner or status in the Conversation. Check domain DNS, sender reputation, and provider limits.  
  

  * Missing Attachments or Broken Formatting: Very large files, blocked types, or certain inline formats may be stripped by providers. Re‑attach files manually or share via a secure link.  
  

  * Replies Not Threading Back: Confirm 2‑way sync is active and healthy for the sending mailbox.  
  

  * Unexpected Sender: Review Sending Priority and mailbox connections to see which address HighLevel selected for the forward.

## **Frequently Asked Questions  
**

  


**Q: Which email address do recipients see?**  
The address follows your account’s sending priority and the mailbox connected to the Conversation’s email channel.

  


**Q: Does forwarding create a new Conversation?**  
No, the forward posts as an outbound message in the same Conversation so teams retain full context.  
  


**Q: Are internal notes or private comments included in a forward?**  
No, only the email content you include in the forward is sent externally. Internal notes remain inside the Conversation for your team.  
  
**Q: What if the recipient replies to my forwarded message?**  
With 2‑way sync active, replies route back to the connected mailbox and appear in the same Conversation thread.  
  


**Q: Is this available on mobile?**  
Mobile availability may vary. If you don’t see the Forward option, use the web app.
