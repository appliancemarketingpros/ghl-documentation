## **Introduction**

The **Bot Status for Individual Contacts** feature gives users enhanced control over when the AI bot interacts with specific contacts. From the message composer, users can easily monitor and set the bot active or inactive for each contact. This feature allows users to turn the bot on or off for individual contacts based on specific needs, ensuring a more personalized and flexible interaction.

  


## **Key Features:**

  1. **Improved Bot Control:** You can now manually adjust the bot's status for each contact
  2. **Active:** The bot will respond to all incoming messages.
  3. **Sleep/Snooze:** The bot is temporarily paused, either manually or due to certain actions (e.g., when a manual or workflow message is sent, or message limits are reached).
  4. **Inactive:** The bot remains off until manually reactivated.
  5. **Sleep Timer:** Users can set a specific time for the bot to automatically wake up and start responding again.


  


## **Step 1: Access the Bot Status Feature**

  * Go to the **Conversations** tab.
  * In the **Message Composer** section for any contact, you will see the bot’s current status, indicated by a green online icon (if active).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does contact-level Inactive override global Conversation AI settings?**  
Yes. When set to **Inactive** , Conversation AI will not reply for that contact until you change the status to **Active**.  
  


**Q: What happens to incoming messages while the bot is Sleeping?**  
Messages are received as normal. Conversation AI remains paused until the wake time, after which it resumes based on your configuration.

  


**Q: Does sending a manual agent message pause the bot automatically?**  
Depending on your global settings, human messages can trigger auto-sleep or delay AI replies to prevent overlap.

  


**Q: Can I bulk-update bot status for many contacts at once?**  
Contact-level status is designed for one-to-one control. Use workflows for conditional or larger-scale changes.

  


**Q: What if the status control isn’t visible?**  
Verify that Conversation AI is enabled, a bot is assigned to the channel, and your response mode supports AI replies.
