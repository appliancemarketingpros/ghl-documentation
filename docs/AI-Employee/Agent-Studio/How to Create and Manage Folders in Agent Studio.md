# **What is Folder Management in Agent Studio?**

  


Folder Management adds a dedicated folder layer to the Agent Studio list page. By grouping agents into folders and giving you power features like bulk move/delete, status labels, and API-backed pagination you can scale from a handful of test bots to hundreds of production agents without losing track of anything.

## **Key Benefits of Folder Management**

  


  * **Visual structure:** Separate experiments from live builds or sort by team, client, or project.


  


  * **Faster housekeeping:** One-click bulk actions slash repetitive work.


  


  * **Instant status insight:** Draft vs. Published labels remove guesswork.


  


  * **High-volume performance:** Server-side pagination and adjustable row counts keep lists snappy.


  


  * **Customizable views:** Choose Folders-first or Agents-first grouping and sort by name or last updated.


  


  * **Fewer mistakes:** Clear confirmation dialogs guard against accidental deletions.


* * *

## **Folder Organization**

  


Create as many parent-level folders as you need, then drag or bulk-move agents between them. Rename or delete folders at any time the underlying agents stay intact.

**Bulk Actions**

  


Select multiple agents or folders and choose:

  


  * **Bulk Delete:** Permanently remove the selected items.

  * **Bulk Move:** Relocate many agents into a different folder in one step.

  * **Bulk Delete Folders:** Clear unused groups (agents inside remain until you delete them).


These actions honor user permissions and show a confirmation with the exact count affected.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Will deleting a folder delete the agents inside it?**

No. Agents move to **“Unfiled”** and remain accessible until you delete them separately.

  


**Q: Can folders be nested?**

The first release supports one folder level. Nested folders are planned for a future update.

  


**Q: Do bulk actions respect user roles?**

Yes, only users with delete/move rights will see those actions, similar to Workflow bulk actions.

  


**Q: Does server-side pagination change my existing filters?**

No, filters remain applied as you page through results.

  


**Q: Why do I see “Draft” on an agent I published last week?**

Publishing creates a live version. If you later edit without republishing, the working copy shows as Draft until you publish again.

  


**Q: What happens if two users move the same agent at once?**

The last saved change wins; you’ll receive a conflict notice if your view is outdated.
