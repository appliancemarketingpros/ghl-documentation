# **What is AI Routing?**

  


AI routing is the process of automatically directing a conversation based on what a user says, rather than relying on rigid keywords or fixed rule trees. Within Agent Studio, the Router node enables this by using natural-language intent detection (AI Router), traditional rule-based logic (Conditional Router), or even a simple no-logic pass-through giving builders precise control over where the conversation moves next without cluttering the canvas.

  


Unlike traditional flow builders that rely heavily on nested If/Else branches, AI routing allows conversations to adapt dynamically based on real user language. By combining AI-based routing with rule-based logic in the same Router node, Agent Studio gives you flexibility to balance intelligent interpretation with precise control.

## **Key Benefits of****AI Routing**

Automates routing with large-language-model intent classification, reducing manual If/Else branches.

  


  * Handles traditional variable checks in the same node, so technical and non-technical teams share one routing tool.


  


  * Works inside Sequential Nodes, allowing mid-sequence branching and return.


  


  * Fails gracefully with a “No Condition” path to keep chats moving even when no rules match.


  


  * New floating configuration panel keeps the entire graph visible while you tweak settings, speeding up complex builds.


* * *

## **AI Router (Intent-Based)**

  


AI Router uses a large-language-model to classify a user’s latest message against your custom “Intents.” Each intent connects to a different branch, letting you pivot the flow when the user says things like “That solved my problem!” or “I’d like a refund.”

  


  * Define unlimited intents with plain-language labels.


  


  * View reasoning, confidence, and chosen intent in the console log for easy debugging.


  


  * Reference runtime variables inside intent labels for contextual matching (e.g., “upgrade to ”).


* * *

## **Conditional Router (Logic-Based)**

Conditional Router evaluates static expressions such as contact fields, tags, or previous node outputs—ideal when you already know which data point should drive the branch (e.g., feedback == "positive").

  


  * Supports multiple conditions and comparison operators.


  


  * Order conditions top-to-bottom; the first match wins.


  


  * Acts as a single replacement for nested If/Else trees.


* * *

## **“No Condition” Toggle**

  


Choose “No Condition” when you just need a visual bridge between two nodes. The router fires immediately, keeping your graph readable while postponing logic to later nodes.

* * *

## **Sequential Node Integration**

  


Drop a Router inside any Sequential Node to inject a decision point mid-sequence. After the branch completes, the flow automatically returns to the next step in the original sequence unless you redirect it elsewhere. This unlocks dynamic detours (like a quick satisfaction survey) without breaking linear automations.

# **How To Setup AI Routing in Agent Studio**

  


A well-structured Router setup ensures conversations move intelligently based on user intent or defined logic. Follow the steps below to configure both AI-based and rule-based routing inside your agent.

  


## **Access Agent Studio**

  


From the left navigation menu, click **AI Agents** and then select the **Agent Studio** tab at the top of the page. This opens the Agent Studio dashboard where you can create, edit, and manage your AI agent conversation flows.

## **Add Router Node**

  


From the **Flow Control** panel on the left, drag the **Router** node onto the canvas to insert a decision point in your conversation flow. Once placed, the **Edit Router** panel opens on the right, where you can choose the routing mode and begin configuring how the conversation should branch.

## **Select Router Type**

  


In the Router configuration panel, choose between **AI Router** and **Conditional Router** under the “Router Type” section. This selection determines whether the routing decision will be based on AI intent detection or rule-based logic.

## **Add Intents**

  


When using AI Router mode, add one or more intents that describe possible user responses. Each intent represents a branch the conversation can follow when the AI detects matching intent from the user’s message.

## **Choose Conditional Mode**

  


Switch to **Conditional Router** if you want routing decisions to be based on structured data instead of natural language interpretation. This mode evaluates variables and predefined logic to determine the next step.

## **Add Condition**

  


Click **Add Condition** to define the rule that will control routing behavior. This opens a configuration panel where you specify what variable to evaluate and how it should be compared.

## **Label Branch**

  


Enter a clear **Label** for the condition branch to identify it within the conversation graph. This label appears on the node connection and helps keep complex flows organized.

## **Set Condition Type**

  


Select the **Condition Type** to define how multiple rules are evaluated. Choose whether all conditions must match (AND) or if any single condition can match (OR).

## **Configure Logic Fields**

  


In the condition editor, select the **Variable** , choose the appropriate **Operator** , and define the expected **Value**. This tells the Router exactly what data to evaluate before proceeding down that branch.

## **Add Additional Conditions**

  


Use the **Add Condition** button to include more logical checks if needed. Multiple conditions allow you to create more precise routing behavior.

## **No Conditions Toggle**

  


Enable **No Conditions** if you want the Router to act as a simple connector without applying any logic. This option immediately passes the flow forward while keeping the graph organized.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does the Router add extra AI message cost?**

Only AI Router executions count toward your LLM billing. Conditional and No-Condition modes are free.

  


**Q: What happens if no intent or condition matches?**

The flow follows the “Default” edge. If none is connected, the conversation ends with an error log entry.

  


**Q: Can I mix AI and Conditional routing in one node?**

One Router node supports one mode at a time, but you can chain multiple Routers back-to-back.

  


**Q: Is intent training required?**

No. The LLM classifies on-the-fly from your intent names and the current conversation context.

  


**Q: How do I debug misplaced routes?**

Open the Execution Log → Routing tab to see the detected intent, reasoning, and confidence or the evaluated condition string.

  


**Q: Will the floating panel replace all pop-ups in Agent Studio?**

Yes, future node types will use the same non-modal panel to keep the canvas visible.
