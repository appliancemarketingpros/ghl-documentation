# **What is Agent Studio?**

  


Agent Studio is a visual platform in HighLevel for creating AI-powered agents. It combines drag-and-drop workflows, versatile tool nodes, and seamless integrations so you can design agents that respond intelligently, automate processes, and connect with external data sources.

  


Agent Studio provides the tools needed to create robust agents that can support customers, streamline operations, and integrate into your existing systems.

##   

    
    
    Note: Agent Studio is available to Agency Admins/Users and Subaccount Admins/Users.

## **Drag-and-Drop Agent Builder**

  


The drag-and-drop builder provides a visual way to create and manage your AI agent workflows. By connecting nodes and setting flow conditions, you can design complex processes with ease.

  


This builder allows you to:

  * Connect tool nodes for logic, data, and intelligence.

  * Configure workflows visually without coding.

  * Manage runtime and global variables for dynamic responses.

## **Tool Nodes**

  


Tool nodes are the core building blocks of Agent Studio. Each node type adds specific functionality, enabling you to design agents that meet your unique needs.

  


### **LLM Node**

  


The LLM node leverages advanced large language models to generate intelligent, context-aware responses. You can configure prompts, parameters, and output handling to suit your workflows.

  


### **MCP Tool Node**

  


The MCP tool node integrates external tools through the Model Context Protocol, extending your agent’s abilities. This is useful for accessing external data sources or triggering actions.

  


### **API Tool Node**

  


The API tool node connects directly to third-party services by sending and receiving data via APIs. This allows your agent to interact with outside systems dynamically.

  


### **Knowledge Base Tool Node**

  


Attach a knowledge base to your agent so it can respond based on uploaded documents or stored information. This ensures accurate and consistent answers.

  


### **Web Search Tool Node**

  


Allow your agent to retrieve the latest information from the internet. This keeps your agent’s responses fresh, relevant, and accurate.

* * *

## **Logic & Flow Control**

  


Logic and flow control features allow your agent to handle complex scenarios and make decisions based on conditions.  
  


  * **Branching via edge conditions** : Define different paths depending on variable values or input.  
  


  * **Variable management** : Create global, runtime, or input variables to ensure context-aware and flexible responses.


* * *

## **Version Control**

  


Agent Studio supports structured lifecycle management with Draft, Staging, and Production modes. This ensures that changes are tested before they go live, preventing disruptions in production.

##   

    
    
    Agent Studio uses version management to help you test changes safely before they affect live conversations.
    
    **Staging:** Your work-in-progress version. Saving updates Staging without impacting live traffic.
    
    **Production:** The live version that runs for real contacts. A Production version is created only when you **promote** a Staging version.
    
    For details on promoting, restoring, and working with multiple Production versions, see: Agent Studio Version Management (Staging, Production, Version History).

## **Export & Import Agents**

  


With export/import functionality, you can back up, share, or move agents between environments. This makes it easier to collaborate or migrate setups without rebuilding agents from scratch.

##   


## **Test Tab**

  


The built-in Test Tab allows you to simulate and validate agent workflows before pushing them to production. This helps you identify errors, confirm logic paths, and refine your agent’s performance.

  


##   


## **API Access**

  


Agent Studio provides secure APIs so you can execute your agents programmatically. This makes it easy to embed agents into your existing systems or workflows.

##   


## **How To Setup Agent Studio**

  


Proper setup ensures you get the most from Agent Studio and its features. Follow these steps to get started:  
  


  1. Navigate to **AI Agents** > **Agent Studio** from your HighLevel dashboard.  
  


  2. Click **Create Agent** to open the drag-and-drop builder.

  5. Configure variables to pass data between nodes.  
  


  6. Use the **Test Tab** to validate your agent’s flow.  
  


  7. Save your agent to create/update the **Staging version**. When you are ready to go live, **promote** the Staging version to **Production**.  
  


  8. (Optional) Export or share your agent if needed.  
  


  9. Use API Access to run agents programmatically.
