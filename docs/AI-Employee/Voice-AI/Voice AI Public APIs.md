# **What are Voice AI Public APIs?**

  


The Voice AI Public APIs give you direct access to configure agents, manage actions, retrieve call data, and integrate web-hooks into your workflows. This elevates Voice AI from a product feature to an extensible capability that can be integrated directly into your workflows and applications.

  


Instead of limiting Voice AI to in-app controls, you can:

  


  * **Manage Agents & Actions: **Create, update, and organize agents and their behaviors via API.  
  

  * **Retrieve Call Data:** Access logs and transcripts for reporting, compliance, or analytics.  
  

  * **Leverage Webhooks:** Receive real-time call outcomes, transcripts, and summaries in your own systems.
