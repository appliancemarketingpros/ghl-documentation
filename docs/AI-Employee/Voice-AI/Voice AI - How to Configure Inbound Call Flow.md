# **What is Inbound Call Flow for Voice AI Calls?**

  


Inbound call flow for Voice AI calls allows HighLevel phone numbers to route incoming calls to a Voice AI agent. This setup helps businesses automate call answering, handle common questions, and make sure callers reach the right experience without relying only on manual call handling.

  


When a phone number is connected to a Voice AI agent, the agent can answer calls, speak with callers, respond based on its configuration, and support your inbound call process.

## **Key Benefits of Setting Up Inbound Call Flow**

  * **Faster response times** : Callers can reach an active Voice AI agent right away when routing is configured correctly.  
  


  * **Better call coverage** : Voice AI can help handle inbound calls outside normal working hours or during busy periods.

## **Voice AI WITHOUT Call Forwarding**

  

    
    
    **IMPORTANT:** If call forwarding is **not enabled** for a phone number used with a Voice AI Agent, the Voice AI Agent will always answer incoming calls to that number.
    
    The only exception is when the phone number assigned to the AI Agent is your **default sub-account phone number**.****

  


There are many reasons why sending your inbound calls directly to your Voice AI Agents would be beneficial, but the most likely scenario is that you are just too busy to answer the phone all day. If this is the case, the Voice AI Agent will be your personal office employee, answering calls, fielding leads, and collecting customer information for further follow-up!

  


**To setup your Voice AI call flow so that your AI Agent always picks up the inbound call:**  
  


  * Do NOT assign your default account phone number to your AI Agent.  
  

  * Do NOT assign call forwarding to the phone number assigned to your AI Agent.

## **Adjust Inbound Call Timeout**

  


Inbound call timeout controls how long HighLevel waits before moving the call to the backup option. Keeping this timeout low helps prevent callers from reaching local voicemail before the Voice AI agent can answer.

  

    
    
    **Important:** If the caller reaches local voicemail, HighLevel will mark the call as completed, and the Voice AI agent will not answer the call.

  


To adjust the timeout:

  


  1. Go to **Settings**.  
  
![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155074739927/original/xkGrBOnJpFCRp5--xlCT5WkTz1n1XEvKmw.jpeg?1782737143)  
  


  2. Select **Phone System**.  
  


  3. Open the **Phone Numbers** tab.

  4. Click the **three-dot menu** next to the number.  
  


  5. Select **Edit Configuration**.

  6. Open the **Call Forwarding** tab.  
  


  7. Locate the **Timeout** setting.  
  


  8. Reduce the timeout to a low value, such as **1–3 seconds**. You may also set it to **0 seconds** depending on your routing needs.  
  


  9. **Save** your changes.
