This provides:  
  


  * Clear visibility of remaining capacity  
  


  * Better booking transparency for customers  
  


  * Improved scheduling efficiency for high-capacity events

## **How Seat Availability Is Calculated (Updated Logic)**

  


Seat availability is determined by the **Seats per class** value configured in your calendar settings.  
  


With the updated scheduling logic:  
  


  * Each confirmed appointment reduces seat availability by 1.  
  


  * If an appointment overlaps multiple slots, only 1 seat is deducted from each affected slot.  
  


  * A slot is blocked only when its total seat capacity is fully reached.  
  


  * Overlapping appointments no longer fully block all affected slots prematurely.


  


This ensures more accurate availability and better utilization of high-capacity calendars.

## **How Seats Appear on the Booking Widget**

  


When enabled, the total remaining seats per time slot are displayed directly on the booking widget.
