## **Overview**

  


Time slot visibility determines whether booking times appear correctly on your public calendar.

  


Slots may not display as expected due to:  
  


  * Calendar configuration settings  
  


  * Assigned team members  
  


  * Slot duration and interval setup  
  


  * Buffer times  
  


  * External calendar conflicts  
  


  * Timezone mismatches  
  


  * Slot capacity limits (for calendars that allow multiple appointments per slot)


  


Understanding how these settings interact will help you quickly identify and resolve booking issues.

* * *

## **Calendar Configuration Checks**

  


Calendar configuration is the foundation of availability logic. Incorrect settings here are a common cause of missing time slots.

* * *

## **Confirm You Are Editing the Correct Calendar**

  


Navigate to:

  


**Calendars → Calendar Settings**

  


Locate the correct calendar and click the **Edit (pencil icon)**.

Make sure you are editing the intended:  
  


  * Calendar Name  
  


  * Calendar Type  
  


  * Calendar Group


* * *

## **Verify Working Hours and Date Overrides**

  


Inside the calendar editor:  
  


  1. Open the **Availability** tab.  
  


  2. Confirm:  
  


     * Weekly hours are correctly configured.  
  


     * No date-specific overrides are blocking availability.

If recurring meetings are enabled, date-specific hours may not apply.

* * *

## **Confirm Assigned Team Members**

  


Availability depends on assigned users.

  


Under **Service Details** , confirm at least one team member is selected.

If no team member is assigned, slots will not appear.

* * *

## **Slot Duration, Interval, and Buffer Settings**

  


Slot configuration affects how booking times are generated.  
  


  


Under the **Availability** tab, review:  
  


  * **Service interval**  
  


  * **Service duration**  
  


  * **Post buffer time**


  


![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/155064724888/original/Ii8Qqe9uGVDGHcTfLecctoHHwTWURWiX4Q.png?1770840817)

  


Improper interval and duration combinations can create gaps or prevent expected time slots from appearing.

* * *

## **Multiple Appointments Per Slot and Capacity Limits (Updated Logic)**

  


If your calendar allows multiple appointments per slot—such as Event or Class calendars—slot visibility depends on capacity.

  


### **Updated Slot Capacity Behavior**

  * Each confirmed appointment reduces slot capacity by 1.  
  


  * If an appointment overlaps multiple time slots, each affected slot’s capacity is reduced by 1.  
  


  * A slot is blocked only when its defined capacity limit is fully reached.  
  


  * Overlapping appointments no longer fully block all affected slots prematurely.


  


If a slot is not appearing, verify whether the maximum appointment limit for that slot has already been reached.

* * *

## **External Calendar Conflicts and Sync**

  


Connected Google or Outlook calendars may block availability.

  


If a synced event is marked **Busy** , it will prevent booking during that time range.

  


Review your connected calendar events and confirm their availability status.

  


External conflicts override internal availability settings.

* * *

## **Timezone Alignment**

  


Timezone mismatches can cause slots to appear at unexpected times or not appear at all.

  


Verify:  
  


  * Your user profile timezone  
  


  * The calendar viewing timezone  
  


  * Client-facing timezone display


  


A time that appears available for one user may not align with another user’s timezone.

## **Using the Calendar Troubleshooting Tool**

  


The built-in Troubleshooting Tool provides a detailed breakdown of slot logic.

  


To access it:  
  


  1. Go to **Calendar Settings**.  
  


  2. Locate the calendar.  
  


  3. Click the **Troubleshoot (wrench icon)**.

The tool shows:  
  


  * Capacity rules  
  


  * Buffer logic  
  


  * Timezone checks  
  


  * User assignment rules  
  


  * External conflicts


  


Use it to determine exactly why a specific slot is blocked.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Why does a team member show available but isn’t getting booked?**

Round Robin logic, availability priority, or user assignment configuration may prevent bookings.

  


**Q: Why are my booking slots not aligning with my working hours?**

Check slot interval, duration, buffer settings, and external conflicts.

  


**Q: Do overlapping appointments block entire slots?**

No. Overlapping appointments reduce slot capacity by 1. A slot is blocked only when its capacity limit is reached.

  


**Q: Why do slots show differently across devices or browsers?**

Browser cache or timezone mismatches may cause inconsistencies.

  


**Q: Can clients choose a preferred team member?**

Yes. Enable staff selection in calendar settings for Round Robin calendars.

  


**Q: What does the Troubleshooting Tool show?**

It lists all rules affecting slot visibility, including capacity limits, buffer times, timezone logic, and user assignment.
