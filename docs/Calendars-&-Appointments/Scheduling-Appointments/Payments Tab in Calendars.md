# **What is the Payments Tab in Calendars?**

  


The **Payments Tab** in the Appointment Modal allows you to manage all payment-related details for an appointment in one place. You can track the amount paid, remaining balance, attendee-wise payment breakdown, transactions, and collect pending payments if needed.

* * *

## **Key Benefits of the Payments Tab**

  
Understanding the advantages helps teams decide when to adopt the feature and how to train staff for faster collections and fewer billing questions.

  


  * **Single source of truth:** All appointment‑level amounts, attendees, and transactions in one place.  
  


  * **Faster collections:** Trigger **Collect Payment** right from the modal to charge a card or record an offline payment.  
  


  * **Attendee clarity:** See who’s paid, partially paid, or still owes; ideal for **Add Guests** bookings.  
  


  * **Discount visibility:** Coupon use and adjusted totals are reflected directly in the summary and transactions.  
  


  * **Cleaner bookkeeping:** A related **Order** is created automatically when calendar payments are enabled, making downstream reporting easier.


* * *

## **Key Features**

  


#### 1\. Payment Summary

  * **Amount Paid** : Total amount already collected for the appointment.

  * **Remaining Balance** : Pending payment that still needs to be collected.

  * **Total Amount** : Overall cost of the appointment after discounts/coupons.  
  


#### 2\. Attendee-Wise Payment Details

  * See payments at the **individual attendee level** (Booker + Guests).

  * Each attendee’s status is shown clearly:

    * **Paid** : Full payment received.

    * **Partially Paid** : Some amount still pending.

    * **Remaining** : Outstanding balance to be collected.  
  


#### 3\. Transaction History

  * View a list of all transactions associated with the appointment.  
  


#### 4\. Collecting Remaining Payments

  * If a balance is due, you’ll see a **Collect Payment** button.

  * Options include:

    * **Charge a Card** – Process credit/debit card payments directly.

    * **Record Manually** – Mark payments collected outside the system (cash, check, etc.).

## **How Payments Work Behind the Scenes**

  


  * When **payments are enabled for a calendar** , an **associated product** is automatically created (visible in the **Products Tab**) with a _Calendar_ tag.  
  


  * These **calendar-linked products cannot be deleted directly** from the Products Tab.  
  


  * When an appointment is booked, an **order is automatically created** (visible in the **Orders Tab**). You don’t need to manage orders separately; everything can be handled directly from the appointment modal.

## **Common Payment Scenarios (Quick Reference)**

  


Use this mini‑guide to anticipate how totals, statuses, and transactions will look based on typical flows.  
  


Scenario| Setup/Action| What You’ll See in Payments Tab  
---|---|---  
**Pay in Full at Booking**|  Enable **Accept Payments** on the calendar; book normally| **Amount Paid** equals **Total Amount** ; attendee statuses = **Paid** ; transactions show charge(s)  
**Deposit (Partial Payment)**|  Enable **Partial Payment/Deposit** ; collect deposit at booking| **Remaining Balance** shows due; after collecting later via **Collect Payment** , statuses update from **Partially Paid** to **Paid**  
**Coupon Applied**|  Enable **Coupon Codes** on the calendar; customer enters code on widget| Summary shows **Discount (Coupon)** line; **Total Amount** reflects discount; transactions include charge(s) against discounted total  
**Add Guests Post‑Booking**|  Edit appointment → add guests → collect per attendee| One order exists from initial booking; additional orders may be created on subsequent saves when **Collect Payment for Guest** is enabled  
**Recurring – First Only**|  Collect only for first occurrence on the widget| Initial appointment shows the payment; later occurrences require manual collection and will initially show balances due  
**Recurring – All Occurrences**|  Collect for all occurrences on the widget| The series total is collected upfront; the appointment record shows paid totals and transactions for the full amount

## **Important Notes & Limitations**

  


These constraints help you avoid edge cases that lead to confusion or duplicate orders.

  


  * Not supported for bookings via older **Service Menu (v1)**.  
  


  * Not supported for **custom recurring appointments** created directly via the in‑app modal.  
  


  * Group bookings: one order is created for the full group at initial booking.  
  


  * Editing an appointment and adding guests with **Collect Payment for Guest** enabled can create a **new order each time you save**. Plan your edits and collections carefully to avoid unintended multiple orders.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Where do coupon discounts show after booking?**  
In the appointment’s **Payments** tab, the **Payment Summary** reflects **Discount (Coupon)** and the **Total Amount** after discount. The **Transaction History** shows charges recorded against the discounted total.  
  


**Q: Can I refund a charge from the Payments tab?**  
Refunds are managed in **Payments → Transactions** (or via your gateway, e.g., PayPal). Once refunded, the appointment’s **Transaction History** reflects the refund entry.  
  


**Q: Does PayPal work with the Payments tab?**  
Yes. PayPal transactions collected via the booking widget appear in **Transaction History** and are tied to the appointment’s order.  
  


**Q: How do recurring series charges display?**  
If you collect for the **first appointment only** , later instances will show balances due until collected. If you collect for **all appointments** , the total appears as paid upfront in the initial booking’s record.
