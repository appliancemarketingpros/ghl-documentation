Snapshot Load Retry helps you quickly recover from snapshot pushes that fail for one or more sub-accounts. Instead of rebuilding a full push, you can retry only the failed sub-accounts directly from Load History and watch the retry progress update in real time. This is especially useful for resolving temporary errors like timeouts or account-specific permission issues.

## **What is Snapshot Load Retry?**

  
Snapshot Load Retry is a recovery tool in HighLevel that lets you re-run failed sub-account imports from the same snapshot load attempt. Keeping retries tied to the original load makes it easier to troubleshoot, audit what happened, and finish a rollout without recreating a brand-new push.

## **Key Benefits of Snapshot Load Retry**

  
Recovering failed snapshot loads quickly prevents delays in onboarding and reduces repetitive work when only part of a batch fails.

  


  * **Time savings:** Retry failed sub-accounts without rebuilding a full snapshot push.  
  


  * **Less manual effort:** Re-run failures with a couple of clicks instead of starting from scratch.  
  


  * **Better organization:** Retries stay grouped under the original load for easier auditing and troubleshooting.  
  


  * **Faster recovery:** Resolve temporary issues (timeouts, intermittent errors, access problems) and complete the push sooner.

## **Where to Find Snapshot Load Retry**

  
Knowing exactly where Snapshot Load Retry lives makes it easier to act quickly when a load fails, especially during larger rollout batches.

  


  1. Go to **Snapshots** in your Agency view.  
  


  2. Open **Load History**.

  3. Select a load that shows one or more failed sub-accounts.

  4. Open the load details to access retry options (such as retrying all failures or retrying selected accounts).

## **Retry All Failed Sub-Accounts**

  
Retry All Failed is the fastest option when multiple sub-accounts in the same batch need another attempt. It reruns only the failed sub-accounts while leaving successful sub-accounts untouched.

  


  1. Open **Snapshots → Load History**.

  2. Click the load that contains failed sub-accounts.

  3. Click **Retry All Failed**.

  4. Watch statuses update as HighLevel retries only the failed items in the batch.


* * *

## **Retry Specific Sub-Accounts**

  
Retry Selected is ideal when only a few sub-accounts failed and you want a targeted retry. This helps you focus on specific accounts after fixing a known issue (like permissions) before re-running the load.

  1. Open **Snapshots → Load History** and select the relevant load.

  2. Expand the batch details to view the sub-account list.

  3. Select the checkbox next to each failed sub-account you want to retry.

  4. Click **Retry Selected**.


* * *

## **Track Retry Progress**

  
Clear progress tracking helps you confirm which sub-accounts recovered successfully and which ones still need attention without switching pages or recreating the push.  
  


  * Status indicators update as retries run (for example: **In Progress** , **Successful** , **Failed**).  
  


  * Progress updates appear within the same load details view, so you don’t need to restart the process.  
  


  * Retry attempts remain associated with the original load for easier review and troubleshooting.


* * *

## **Retry Availability Rules**

  
These safeguards help ensure retries remain reliable and prevent you from reloading outdated snapshot content into sub-accounts. Snapshot Load Retry is unavailable in these scenarios:

  


  * **48-hour limit:** Loads older than 48 hours can’t be retried. Create a new load instead.  
  


  * **Snapshot refreshed or modified:** If the snapshot was refreshed/updated after the original load, start a new load to ensure the most current snapshot version is applied.


* * *

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Does Snapshot Load Retry apply new changes I made to the snapshot?**  
No. If the snapshot was refreshed or updated after the original load, start a new load to ensure the latest snapshot version is used.

  


**Q: Can I retry a snapshot load after 48 hours?**  
No. Retry is only available within 48 hours of the original load. After that, create a new load.

  


**Q: Will retrying overwrite the sub-accounts that were successful the first time?**  
No. Retry actions run only for the sub-accounts that failed. Successful sub-accounts are not retried.

  


**Q: Who can run Snapshot Load Retry?**  
Users who have access and permissions to push/load snapshots in the Agency view can run retries from Load History.
