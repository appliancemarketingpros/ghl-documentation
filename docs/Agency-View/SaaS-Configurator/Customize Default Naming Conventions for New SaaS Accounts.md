# **What Is the Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Sub-Accounts?**

  
This setting defines the **default naming convention** used when HighLevel creates a **new SaaS sub-account** during checkout. Agencies can pick **Company Name** (the business provided during checkout) or keep the traditional **Customer Name + ’s Account** format. The choice applies to **future** sign-ups and does **not** rename existing accounts.

  

    
    
    Note: This option lives in the **SaaS Configurator** at the Agency level and is available to agencies with **SaaS Mode** on the **Agency Pro ($497) plan**. If you’re on Starter or Freelancer, upgrade to **Agency Pro** to access SaaS Configurator features.

## **Key Benefits of Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Subscribers**

  


  * **Improved Clarity:** Sub-account names reflect the operating business rather than only the buyer’s personal name.  
  


  * **Enhanced Client Experience:** Reduces manual post-onboarding updates by applying your preferred naming automatically.  
  


  * **Operational Efficiency:** Makes accounts easier to search, filter, and recognize for support and success teams.  
  


  * **Flexible Options:** Switch between **Company Name** and **Customer Name + ’s Account** to match your internal workflow.


* * *

## **How To Setup Default Naming Convention for New SaaS Subscribers**

  


  1. Open **SaaS Configurator** → **Advanced Settings** → **Sub-Account** **Onboarding**.  
  


  2. Under**Sub-Account Onboarding** , choose one:

     * **Company Name** (recommended for business-forward clarity), or

     * **Customer Name + ’s Account** (useful if your team searches primarily by owner).  
  


  3. Click **Save**. New SaaS sub-accounts created via HighLevel funnels (and supported external checkouts) will now follow your selection.

## **Naming Convention Options**

  
Review what each option does so you can align the default with how your team identifies and supports new customers.

  


  * **Company Name** — Uses the **business name** provided at checkout so the sub-account clearly represents the client’s brand.

    * _Example:_ **Acme Dental**  
  


  * **Customer Name + ’s Account** — Uses the buyer’s personal name with **’s Account** appended.

    * _Example:_ **Jane Smith’s Account**  
  


    
    
    **Note:** If the Company Name field is not present or is left empty during checkout, HighLevel defaults to Customer Name + ’s Account.  
    

* * *

## **External Checkout Integration**

  
You can extend the same naming behavior **beyond** HighLevel funnel checkouts by passing the client’s business name from your external checkout into HighLevel as metadata.  
  


  * Ensure your external checkout sends a **non-empty** `companyName` **subscription metadata** value.  
  


  * Keep the SaaS Configurator set to **Use Company Name** to apply the business name when metadata is present.  
  


  * If `companyName` is missing or empty, HighLevel falls back to **Customer Name + ’s Account**.

## **Behavior & Examples**

  
These quick examples clarify what you and your clients will see after signup so expectations are aligned.

  


  * **If “Company Name” is selected and provided at checkout:**

    * _Resulting sub-account:_ **Acme Dental**

  * **If “Company Name” is selected but not provided:**

    * _Resulting sub-account:_ **Jane Smith’s Account** _(fallback to customer name)_

  * **If “Customer Name + ’s Account” is selected:**

    * _Resulting sub-account:_ **Jane Smith’s Account**


  

    
    
    **Note:** After Account Creation admins can update the **Location’s Friendly Business Name** later if needed. Changing this later does not retroactively change past confirmations or emails already sent. ****

  


## **Company name capture**

  


HighLevel captures the Company Name a customer enters at checkout and includes it in the subscription’s metadata as `companyName`.

  


This applies to:

  * V2 funnels using the Payments ecosystem (metadata passed via APIs)
  * SaaS V1 setups using Stripe (metadata passed via Stripe)

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  
**Q:****Does this setting affect existing SaaS accounts?**  
No. It applies only to **new** SaaS sign-ups after you save the setting.

  


**Q:****What happens if no Company Name is provided during checkout?**  
HighLevel defaults to **Customer Name + ’s Account**.

  


**Q: Can we change the default later?**  
Yes. Update the option in **SaaS Configurator** at any time. It applies to **future** sign-ups.

  


**Q:****How do we enable this for external checkouts?**  
Send a **non-empty** `companyName` in subscription metadata and keep the setting on **Use Company Name**.

  


**Q:****Will changing the setting rename previously created accounts?**  
No. There’s no retroactive renaming.

  


**Q: Does this influence merge fields like**`**{{location.name}}**`**in communications?**  
The initial Location name reflects the chosen convention at creation. Messages using `{{location.name}}` will display that name unless it’s edited later in the Location settings.

  


**Q:****Could unusual characters in Company Name cause issues?**  
Use standard alphanumeric characters where possible for best results. If a name is not accepted by your external checkout or looks incorrect, edit the Location name after creation.
