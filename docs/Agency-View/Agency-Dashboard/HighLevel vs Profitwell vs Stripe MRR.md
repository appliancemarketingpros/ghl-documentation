## Why MRR Can Differ Across Tools

If you use tools like **ProfitWell** or **Stripe** , you might notice your **Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** numbers differ slightly from what you see in **HighLevel**.

That’s perfectly normal — each platform uses its own interpretation of MRR and applies different timing rules for recognizing revenue events.

At HighLevel, our goal is to provide an **accurate, event-driven** , and **real-time representation** of your recurring revenue across **SaaS** and **Reselling** subscriptions.

  

    
    
    **Tip:**
    If you ever notice a case where MRR looks different from what you expected, please reach out to our **Support Team**.
    Our team will be happy to review the subscription data with you and confirm how the calculation applies.

## Overview: What HighLevel Includes in MRR

**Dashboard Tab**| **MRR Source**| **Includes**| **Excludes**  
---|---|---|---  
**Summary Tab**|  Combined MRR| MRR from **both SaaS and Reselling subscriptions** created inside HighLevel| Subscriptions created outside HighLevel  
**SaaS Tab**|  SaaS MRR| Only MRR from **SaaS subscriptions**|  Reselling and external subscriptions  
**Reselling Tab**  
(Coming Soon)  
| Reselling MRR| Only MRR from **Reselling subscriptions**|  SaaS and external subscriptions  
  
  

    
    
    **Important:**
    MRR is calculated only from subscriptions **created and managed within HighLevel**.
    Subscriptions originating **outside HighLevel** (for example, directly in Stripe) are not included.

## Comparison: MRR Calculation Across Platforms

**Scenario**| **HighLevel (HL)**| **ProfitWell**| **Stripe**  
---|---|---|---  
**1️⃣ Cancellation / Churn Timing**|  MRR is recognized **until the actual cancellation date** (i.e., the end of the billing cycle). If a subscription is scheduled for cancellation, it remains active until the cycle ends.| Recognizes MRR **until the end of the billing cycle** — i.e., MRR remains until the actual cancellation takes effect.| Cancelling immediately removes MRR **at the time of cancellation** , even if access continues until the end of the period.  
**2️⃣ New Business and Churn in the Same Month**|  Recognizes **both new and churn MRR** if both happen in the same month.| Excludes such customers entirely from that month’s calculation to avoid “double counting” (neither new nor churn recorded).| Recognizes **both** new and churn MRR in the same month, reflecting both transactions.  
**3️⃣ Discounts and Credits**|  Always subtracts discounts and credits **before calculating MRR** , regardless of duration or type.| Subtracts discounts/credits before MRR calculation.| Handles discounts differently: **permanent (forever) coupons** reduce MRR, while **limited-time or one-off coupons** may not.  
**4️⃣ One-Off Refunds**| **Ignored** from MRR (not recurring). Only recurring price changes affect MRR.| **Ignored** from MRR unless refund permanently alters recurring value.| May reduce MRR if the refund cancels or modifies an active subscription in Stripe.  
**5️⃣ Paused Subscriptions**|  Considered as **contraction**. If resumed, it’s treated as expansion MRR.| Sets MRR to **$0 while paused** , then resumes MRR upon reactivation.| Also sets MRR to **$0 while paused** , with MRR returning when reactivated.  
**6️⃣ Free Plans / Trials**| **Excluded** from MRR until upgraded to a paid plan. However, they **do count as active subscribers** in other metrics.| **Excluded** from MRR — only paid, recurring subscriptions count.| **Excluded** from MRR; trial revenue not included.  
**7️⃣ Past-Due Subscriptions**|  Treated as **active** until they move to “Cancelled” or “Unpaid” after the dunning process ends.| Same approach — remains active until marked as unpaid or cancelled.| Same — active and contributes to MRR until failure completes dunning and subscription cancels.

## Currency Handling

All amounts are **converted into USD** before MRR is calculated.  
This ensures your agency’s dashboard presents comparable data across global customers.

  

    
    
    **Coming soon:**
    Multi-currency support for viewing MRR in your preferred local currency.

## Tip: If Your MRR Looks Different

If you spot any unexpected variations, for example:

  * A subscription’s MRR looks higher/lower than Stripe, or

  * An expansion or churn didn’t appear as expected


? **Contact our Support Team** via the in-app chat or submit a support request.  
Our team can trace the subscription events, discounts, and states to confirm how the value was derived.
