Take your B2B automation to the next level. Company-Based Workflows let you trigger and run automations directly on Company records—so you can onboard accounts, sync data, and keep every contact in-step without touching another tool.

# **What is Company-Based Workflows?**

  
Company-Based Workflows let you automate at the **account level** by targeting the **Company** object—rather than a single Contact. This enables onboarding, lifecycle updates, data hygiene, and reporting alignment for B2B accounts with multiple stakeholders, all from one centralized automation.

  


Company-Based Workflows are a workflow type in HighLevel that starts from Company events (for example, when a Company is created or updated) and runs actions that write directly to Company fields or to **Contacts associated with that Company**. This bridges the gap between contact-level and account-level automation, unlocking true B2B use cases in HighLevel.

## **Key Benefits of Company-Based Workflows**

  
Focusing automation at the Company level improves data consistency and operational efficiency across teams. The benefits below frame the **business outcomes** customers can expect, with examples for real-world implementation.

  


  * **B2B onboarding** : Launch account-level onboarding the moment a Company is created.  
  


  * **Data sync** : Keep Company and associated Contact data aligned to reduce manual updates.  
  


  * **CRM hygiene** : Clear outdated Company fields on status changes to maintain clean reports.  
  


  * **Ownership consistency** : Standardize Account Owner assignment for all related Contacts.  
  


  * **Works with Contact workflows** : Combine Company and Contact workflows to design end-to-end automation.

## **Company Workflow Triggers & Actions**

  
Use this matrix to plan **when** a Company-based workflow should start and **what** it should do. Triggers define the starting event on the **Company** object, while actions update Company fields, create/associate records, or optionally impact **associated Contacts**. Filter triggers to narrow scope, and choose actions that align with your data model and safeguards.

  


### **Company Workflow Triggers**

  


Name (UI label)| Starts When| Filters/Conditions  
---|---|---  
**Company Created**|  A new Company record is added| Basic filters; segment by owner, tags, fields, or other attributes  
**Company Changed**|  One or more Company fields are updated| Field/value conditions (where available) to react only to specific changes  
  
###   


### **Company Workflow Actions**

  


Name (UI label)| Available In| Primary Purpose| Key Options  
---|---|---|---  
**Create Company or Associated Contact**|  Company-based & Contact-based| Create a new Company or add a Contact to an existing Company| Choose create mode; map essential fields  
**Update Company or Associated Contact**|  Company-based & Contact-based| Keep Company data current and optionally sync to associated Contacts| Map fields with static or dynamic values; option to apply to associated Contacts (where available)  
**Clear Fields of Company or Associated Contact**|  Company-based & Contact-based| Remove outdated values to maintain CRM hygiene| Select specific fields to reset  
**Create Associated Company** | Contact-based only| Create and link a Company from a Contact record| Map Company fields from Contact/context  
**Update Associated Company** | Contact-based only| Update the Company linked to the current Contact| Map fields; optionally gate with conditions  
**Clear Fields of Associated Company**|  Contact-based only| Reset selected Company fields from a Contact-based workflow| Choose fields to clear

## **Typical Use Cases**

  
Use cases translate features into **repeatable recipes**. Start here to design a first pass, then refine with conditions and branching as your process matures.  
  


  * **Onboard new client Companies** : Assign Account Owner, set lifecycle stage, and notify all associated Contacts with a welcome email sequence.  
  


  * **Mirror lifecycle stages** : When a Company’s health or status changes, update relevant flags on associated Contacts for success and retention workflows.  
  


  * **Data hygiene** : Clear time-bound fields (e.g., promo or temporary discounts) after a set duration.  
  


  * **Create Companies from inbound forms** : Build a Company from a B2B lead form and immediately associate the submitting Contact.  
  


  * **Push Company attributes to Contacts** : Sync domain, industry, segment, or plan tier to Contacts for segmentation and reporting.

## **How To Set Up Company-Based Workflows**

  
A clean setup ensures accurate triggers, safe field updates, and predictable outcomes. Build in a test path first, then roll out widely to production Companies.

  


  1. **_Create the workflow_**  
 _  
_Navigate to**Automation → Workflows → + Create Workflow**.  
Choose **Company-based Workflow** as the type.

  2. **_Add a trigger_** _  
_  
Select**Company Created** or **Company Changed**.

  3. **_Add actions_** _  
_

  4. **_Add logic, delays, and branches (optional)_**_  
_  
Use Conditions, If/Else, or Wait steps to control timing and scope.  
Keep loops in check—avoid bi-directional “mirror” updates without guardrails.  
  


  5. **_Save, test, then publish_** _  
_  
**Save** and enroll a small set of Companies to validate mappings.  
Review the execution log for successful actions.  
**Publish** once validated.

**Q: Can one workflow update both the Company and its associated Contacts?**  
Yes. Use **Update Company or Associated Contact** and select options to apply changes to associated Contacts where available.

  


**Q: Can I create a Company from a Contact-based workflow?**

Use filters or Smart Lists to enroll a targeted set of Companies, validate on a small batch, then scale up.
