The process is broken into two main stages:

  1. **Data Setup:** You must first use **Custom Fields** to store your clients' individual Tax IDs and **Custom Values** to store your agency's Tax ID. This creates the required data points in your system.
  2. **Layout Implementation:** The final step involves customizing the default **Invoice Layout** in your payment settings. You map the stored data—placing your **Business Tax ID** under the business details section and the client's **Tax ID** under the contact section.


By following this setup, your invoices will automatically pull and display both required identification numbers whenever they are present against the contact and in your custom values.
