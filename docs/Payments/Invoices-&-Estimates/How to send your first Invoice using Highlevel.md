### Overview

  


You can now send invoices to your customers/clients using the **Products** you have created in your sub-account or by simply typing things within the invoice. There are two types of invoices available 

  1. Invoices &
  2. Recurring invoices (_[How to Edit Recurring Invoices](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/en/support/solutions/articles/155000004403>)_)

In this article we are going to see how to create an invoice.

  

    
    
    If you are using invoicing without Stripe Connect, please see this guide : [Using invoices for recording manual payments without Stripe Connect](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001220600-common-uses-cases-for-payments-and-invoices#Using-invoices-for-recording-manual-payments-without-Stripe-Connect>). The limitation is that you will need to **manually record the payments**.

  * And when you click on the 3dots next to the Save option you can Preview the invoice , Manage Payment methods and edit global invoice settings.

    * After sending an invoice: **Contact → Email → View Invoice**

  * The accurate preview will show the full invoice as recipients will see it, including proper formatting such as single-line item names when applicable.

  * When opening the full preview, it launches in a **new browser tab**. Return to the editor by switching back to the original tab.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)

  


## Q: Why is my logo missing on older invoices, but shows up on new ones?

Your logo is missing because the original image file was deleted from your Media Library.

Invoices pull the logo from its original file location. If you delete that file, the link breaks for all existing invoices.

How to Fix It:

  * For New Invoices: The system is fine; it's using the current logo from your settings.

  * For Unpaid Invoices: Upload a new logo to your Media Library and make sure your Business Details are updated with this new image. The logo will reappear on these.

  * For Paid Invoices: The logo cannot be fixed because paid records cannot be edited. You would have to manually add the logo to the PDF if you need to resend a receipt.


Reference: [Business Profile Settings - General Information](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/155000006181-business-profile-settings-general-information#Business-Logo>)

##   


Q: I'm unable to enter text for my Terms & Conditions or notes in the invoice editor; only the formatting toolbar (Bold, Italic, etc.) is displayed. How do I fix it?

This issue is a local browser error that happens when the text editor fails to load correctly, usually due to a conflict with old data (cache and cookies) stored in your web browser.

To fix the missing text box:

  1. Fully clear the cache and cookies in your web browser.

  2. Close all tabs, then log back into your HighLevel account.

  3. The text editor should now load correctly, allowing you to input your terms and conditions.


##   


Q: Where to find the latest invoice linked to my account?

All invoices can be located under Payments in the Billing Dashboard from the agency view.

  


Q: My invoice says "Sent," but the client or agent never got it. What's wrong and how do I fix it?

Issues with email sending often stem from browser-related problems rather than system malfunctions. Specifically, outdated cached data and cookies in your web browser can create errors, leading to a false indication that an email has been sent.

To resolve this:

  1. Instruct the team member to clear their browser's cache and cookies.

  2. Have them log out and then log back into their account.

  3. Attempt to resend the estimate.

Q: How do I bill a client in USD if my account is set to another currency? 

You cannot simply type the amount into an invoice. You must first go to Payments > Products, create a new product, and select USD from the currency dropdown menu. When creating the invoice, click Add Item and select that specific USD product. This ensures Stripe handles the currency conversion and processing correctly.

  


  


Q: I sent an invoice, but my client says the link is broken or they can't click it to pay. What happened and how do I fix it?

The payment link is disabled because the invoice is past its scheduled due date. The system automatically deactivates the payment option when the payment date has already passed.

To fix it: 

  1. you must send a new invoice with a corrected schedule:

  2. Duplicate (Clone) the original invoice.

  3. Adjust the Payment Schedule dates to a current or future date.

  4. Resend the new invoice to your client. The link will then be active.


  


Q: Can I charge a one-time setup fee and a monthly subscription on the same invoice?

No. Because the system manages one-time and recurring payments using different billing logic, you must create two separate invoices to handle these charges:

  * One-Time Invoice: Use this to bill for the setup fee. This is a single, non-repeating transaction.

  * Recurring Invoice: Use this to bill for the monthly subscription. This allows the system to automatically generate new invoices and charge the client on a repeating schedule.


  


Q: Why am I receiving an error when trying to send an invoice via text (SMS)? 

This usually happens for one of two reasons:

  1. Invalid Number: The phone number might be incorrect, out of service, or unreachable.

  2. DND Enabled: The recipient may have DND (Do Not Disturb) enabled on their carrier settings, which blocks automated or promotional text messages.


Q: Why does the system seem to be skipping invoice numbers ?

This typically happens when Draft invoices are deleted. Invoice numbers are reserved the moment an invoice is created, even if it is still in Draft mode.

  


Q: Can I reuse a skipped invoice number to keep my records sequential? 

Yes. While the system will not automatically recycle the deleted number, you can manually override the invoice number field when creating a new invoice. Simply type in the skipped number to maintain continuity in your ledger.

  


Q: Can I "unvoid" an invoice or mark a voided invoice as paid?

No. In HighLevel, voiding an invoice is considered a final action. Once an invoice is voided, its value is set to zero for accounting purposes, and it cannot be moved back to "Sent," "Open," or "Paid" status.

  


Q: Where do I find the notes I added when recording a manual payment?

Notes added during a manual payment (Cash, Check, or Bank Transfer) are stored within the Transaction details of the invoice. To view them, follow these steps:

  1. Navigate to Payments > Invoices.

  2. Locate and click on the specific Paid invoice you want to check.

  3. Click the three dots (⋮) at the top right of the invoice screen.

  4. Select View Transaction from the dropdown menu.

  5. In the transaction window that appears, look for the Notes section. Your previously recorded notes will be displayed there.


Q: How do I change an invoice from Test mode to Live mode?  
Once an invoice is created in Test mode, it cannot be converted to Live. To send it live, clone the invoice and send the cloned version in Live mode.  
  


  1. Go to Invoices

  2. Locate the invoice created in Test mode

  3. Click the three dots (⋮) next to the invoice

  4. Select Clone

  5. Open the cloned invoice (it will be created as a Draft)

  6. Review or edit details if needed

  7. Click Send and Choose Live mode when sending  


Q: My client says they never received their invoice. How can I verify this?

You can track the exact journey of an invoice email through the Conversations tab. This provides real-time data from the mail server that the "Sent" status in the Invoices tab cannot show.

Step 1: Go to the Contact Record for the client in question.

Step 2: Click on the Conversations tab in the center of the screen.

Step 3: Locate the outbound message containing the invoice.

Note: Ensure you are looking at the Email icon (envelope) and not the SMS icon (phone), as automated invoices are typically sent via email.

Step 4: Hover over the message and click the three dots (More Actions), then select Details.

  


Q: Why do I get a “Something went wrong” error when trying to send an invoice?

This error usually occurs when the invoice has not been fully saved before attempting to send it. When you click Send, the system first creates (clones) a finalised copy of the invoice for delivery via email or SMS. If the invoice is still in a draft or unsaved state, this cloning process fails and triggers the generic “Something went wrong” error.

  1. Open the invoice you want to send.

  2. Click Save and wait for the “Successfully Saved” confirmation message.

  3. Once saved, click Send again.  
  


Q: Why is the tax not calculated correctly on my invoice after I apply a discount?

This issue often occurs due to a conflict in your global Tax Inclusion Settings, which dictates how the price and tax are calculated relative to each other.

To fix this, you need to ensure the system knows that the product price should be treated as exclusive of tax before applying any discount:

  1. Navigate to Payments → Settings.

  2. Change the Tax Inclusion setting from the incorrect option (e.g., "Tax will be included in the purchase price") to:  
"Tax will not be included in the purchase price. The price shown to the customer is not inclusive of tax."


This forces the system to calculate the tax and add it after the discounted subtotal, correcting the final invoice amount.

  


Q: Does a late invoice show both the original amount and the late fee?

Yes. When a late fee is applied, it is added to the same invoice, showing both the original amount and the late fee as a single total. The customer is also notified by email when the late fee is charged.

Q: Why am I getting an error when setting installment due dates on an invoice?  
Because installment due dates must be on or before the main invoice due date. Update the invoice’s main due date first, then set the instalment dates and save.

### Q: Why is the invoice not sent immediately?  
If the system says the invoice will arrive “in one day” even though the due date is set to today, check the following:

  * Issue Date vs. Due Date  
Make sure the Issue Date is set to Today. If the issue date is in the future (even by one day), the system will delay sending, regardless of the due date.

  * Timezone Settings  
Go to Settings → Business Profile and verify the account timezone. If it’s set to a different timezone (e.g. US/Eastern), “today” may not have started yet for the system.

  * Recurring vs. One-Time Invoice  
Recurring invoices are processed in scheduled batches. For immediate delivery, use a One-Time Invoice and click Send manually.


### Q: How can I send an invoice to multiple recipients?  
By default, invoices are sent only to the primary email address on the contact. To send it to additional recipients, click Send and use the CC option to add another email address before sending.

### Q: How can I collect a client’s credit card details before a future invoice date?  
Scheduled invoices do not collect credit card details until they are sent on the due date. The system only saves (“vaults”) a card when a transaction or authorization happens.  
If an invoice is scheduled for a future date (e.g., February 1st), it is not sent yet, so the client has no way to enter their card details.

### To collect card details in advance:

  * ### Add a small setup fee (recommended):  
Add a one-time setup fee (e.g., $1). The invoice is sent immediately, the client pays the small amount, and their card is saved for the future charge.

  * ### Use a trial period:  
Start the recurring invoice today and add a trial period that ends on the billing date. The client enters their card to start the trial, and the full charge happens when the trial ends.

  * ### Use a zero-dollar order form:  
Create an order form that collects credit card details without charging. Once the card is saved, enable auto-payment on the future invoice.
