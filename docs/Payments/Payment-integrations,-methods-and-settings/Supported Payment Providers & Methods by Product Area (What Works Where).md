## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Why does the wallet button (e.g., Apple Pay/Google Pay) not appear even though the table shows “Y”?**

Wallet buttons only appear in supported environments: **Apple Pay on Apple devices** (iPhone/iPad/Mac) and **Google Pay on Android**. Make sure the method is enabled with your provider and the wallet is set up on the device.

  


**Q: The table shows “Y” for a provider—does that guarantee subscriptions will work?**

Not necessarily. Some methods support only one-time payments. Check the **Note** above and test your recurring use case before launch.

  


****Q: Can I show Stripe and PayPal together on the same checkout?** **

In many product areas you can offer more than one option if both are connected and enabled. The checkout will show the available buttons/options automatically.

  


**Q: Do card readers work on Order Forms or Invoices?**

No. Card readers are only marked **Y** for **POS**. Use POS for in‑person payments.
