# **What is Adyen Payments Integration?**

  


Adyen Payments Integration connects an existing Adyen merchant account to HighLevel so you can process card transactions on supported sales channels using Adyen’s PCI-compliant infrastructure. This enables agencies and sub-accounts to meet enterprise procurement requirements while keeping payment collection inside HighLevel.

Adyen Payments Integration lets administrators add Adyen credentials (Company API Key and, for Live, the Live URL Prefix) in HighLevel and route eligible card transactions through Adyen on selected channels such as Invoices and Payment Links.

## **Key Benefits of Adyen Payments Integration**

  


Understanding the value helps you decide when to choose Adyen over other processors connected to your sub-account. These benefits focus on enterprise needs, geographic coverage, and security.

  


  * **Enterprise readiness:** win deals with companies that standardize on Adyen.  
  


  * **3D Secure (3DS) support:** adds an extra authentication layer for high-risk or cross-border payments.  
  


  * **Broader EU & North America coverage:** onboard businesses operating in those regions with a single provider.  
  


  * **Fast client adoption:** existing Adyen merchants can plug in credentials and start selling quickly.

  4. _(Live only)_ Paste your **Live URL Prefix**.  
  


  5. Click **Save**. A success message confirms the connection.

## **Testing with Adyen (Sandbox)**

  


Testing prevents unintended charges and helps verify 3DS behavior before switching to Live.  
  


  * Use **Test** mode to simulate card payments; no real charges occur.  
  


  * Use Adyen-provided **test card numbers** and follow any 3DS prompts to confirm authentication flows.  
  


  * After successful tests, switch the integration to **Live** , add the **Live URL Prefix** , and repeat a low-value verification payment.

## **Refunds & Disputes**

  


Knowing where to issue refunds and manage disputes reduces delays and chargeback risk for your clients.  
  


  * **Refunds:** If refunds are enabled for your account within HighLevel, you can issue full or partial refunds from **Payments → Transactions** (or from the related Invoice). Otherwise, refunds can be initiated directly in your Adyen dashboard.  
  


  * **Disputes/Chargebacks:** Disputes are managed in **Adyen**. Monitor dispute notifications and provide evidence per Adyen’s timelines and guidance.  
  


  * Refund timing, fees, and settlement adjustments are determined by Adyen.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Can I enable Apple Pay or Google Pay through Adyen in HighLevel?**  
Not at launch. The integration currently supports card payments only.

  


**Q: Is there extra HighLevel transaction pricing on top of Adyen fees?**  
No. Transactions are processed by Adyen under your existing Adyen pricing.

  


**Q: What happens if I leave the Live URL Prefix blank in Live mode?**  
Live transactions will fail because Adyen cannot route the request without the prefix.

  


**Q: Can I connect both Stripe and Adyen to the same sub-account?**  
Yes. Keep multiple gateways connected and select a **Default Provider** per channel.

  


**Q: Does 3DS require a HighLevel setting?**  
No. 3DS challenge flows are handled by Adyen during checkout when required.

  


**Q: Where do I see Adyen payouts and fees?**  
In your Adyen dashboard. Settlement timing and fees are determined by Adyen.

  


**Q: Is the Adyen integration card-only at launch?**
