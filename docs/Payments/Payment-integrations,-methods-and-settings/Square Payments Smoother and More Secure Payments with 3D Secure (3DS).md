HighLevel now supports 3D Secure (3DS) with Square, adding an extra layer of cardholder authentication to online checkouts. This enhancement automatically triggers the verification step whenever a buyer’s card or regional regulations require Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), helping you capture more payments while keeping fraud at bay.

## **What is 3D Secure (3DS) for Square?**

  


3D Secure (3DS) is an industry-standard protocol that prompts the buyer to verify their identity (e.g., a one-time SMS code, Face ID, or redirect to the issuing bank) before the transaction can be authorized. Enabling 3DS greatly reduces fraud-related chargebacks because liability shifts to the card issuer once authentication succeeds. Square provides 3DS as part of its built-in Risk Manager, and HighLevel now passes the required data so Square can invoke the extra verification step whenever needed.

## **Key Benefits of 3D Secure (3DS) for Square**

  


The new Square 3DS integration delivers immediate advantages:

  


  * Fewer payment failures on cards that mandate 3DS, boosting conversion rates.  
  

  * Added fraud protection and chargeback liability shift once authentication succeeds.  
  

  * Automatic SCA compliance in regions such as the UK and EU—no extra coding required.  
  

  * A friction-light, in-checkout pop-up keeps customers inside your HighLevel funnel for a smoother experience.


* * *

## **3DS High-Level Checkout Flow**

  


3DS is entirely automatic once your Square account is connected in HighLevel.

  


  * The Buyer enters the required billing address and contact fields on an Order Form, Payment Element, Invoice, or Store checkout.  
  

  * HighLevel sends the transaction request to Square; Square risk rules decide whether 3DS is required based on the card, amount, location, and other factors.  
  

  * If 3DS is triggered, a secure pop-up/modal appears for the buyer to complete authentication.  
  

  * On successful verification, the payment is captured, and the HighLevel order/invoice status updates to “Paid.”  
  

  * If verification fails or times out, the payment is declined, and HighLevel surfaces the error so the buyer can try another card.


* * *

## **Prerequisites & Supported Flows**

  


3DS for Square is available anywhere you can already accept Square card payments in HighLevel: Order Forms, Payment Links, Ecommerce Store, Invoices, and more. 

  


Prerequisites:

  


  * A connected Square account at Sub-Account → Payments → Integrations.  
  

  * Square location set to Live mode.  
  

  * Billing Address + Email/Phone fields visible (and preferably required) on the checkout form so Square can validate the buyer.  
  

  * The buyer uses a card and an issuing bank that supports 3DS.


* * *

## **3DS Error Handling & Troubleshooting**

  


Understanding common scenarios helps you support customers:

  


  * **“Authentication failed”** — Buyer entered an incorrect SMS code or declined Face ID. Ask them to retry or use another card.  
  

  * **“Issuer declined”** — The card-issuing bank blocked the transaction before or after 3DS. Suggest contacting their bank.  
  

  * **“3DS not completed”** — Buyer closed the pop-up. Please encourage them to complete the step.


  


HighLevel always logs the gateway response under Payments → Transactions for easy reference.

* * *

## **How does it work?**

  


  * **Square** : No setup needed - it just works once the address and contact fields are added by the customer during checkout.  
  

  * **NMI** : A quick one-time setup is required to enable 3DS:


  


  * Enroll in Payer Authentication 2.0 in your NMI account.  
  

  * Confirm the service status is Active.  
  

  * Generate a Checkout Public Key for 3DS in your NMI Merchant Portal, and add it to your HighLevel integration.


  


Once set up, whenever a card requires 3DS, your customers will automatically see a pop-up to verify and complete their payment. Refer to the [Help article](<https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001235741-how-to-set-up-the-nmi-integration->).

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

  


**Q: Do I need to enable anything in the Square Dashboard?**

No. Square’s default Risk Manager rules already apply 3DS to high-risk or SCA-mandated transactions.

  


  


**Q: Does 3DS work for saved “Card on File” payments?**

Square 3DS applies only to real-time cardholder-initiated payments. Card-on-file debits are exempt. 

  


  


**Q: Is there an extra fee for using 3DS?**

Square does not charge additional 3DS fees; standard Square processing rates apply.

  


  


**Q: Will 3DS appear on every transaction?**

No. The card issuer and Square’s risk engine decide when to trigger 3DS. Many low-risk payments go straight through without the challenge.

  


  


**Q: Can I disable 3DS?**

You cannot disable 3DS from inside HighLevel; Square manages the rules. You may adjust risk rules in the Square Dashboard, but this is not recommended for SCA regions.

  


  


**Q: Does 3DS slow down checkout?**

The additional step adds only a few seconds and is embedded in-page, minimizing friction.

  


  


**Q: Is 3DS supported on POS or Mobile Payments?**

No. 3DS is solely for online (card-not-present) flows. In-person Square POS transactions use chip or tap for security instead.

  


  


**Q: How do I troubleshoot repeated 3DS failures?**

Check that the billing address matches the card issuer’s records, confirm the buyer’s device allows pop-ups, and ask them to retry with another card if problems persist.
