The integration provides capabilities to accept one time, custom amounts as well as recurring payments across all channels like order forms, invoices, payment links, forms, contacts page among others. This also provides subscription management like cancellation, updating a card on file or refund related capabilities

Sub-account users will be able to install the application from the App Marketplace, authenticate using the necessary API keys, and grant necessary permissions to start accepting payments using Razorpay.

###   


To successfully connect Razorpay with your system, please follow these four essential steps:

  1. **Install the Razorpay App**  
Navigate to the **App Marketplace** and install the Razorpay application.  
  


  2. **Authenticate Using API Keys**  
Copy your Razorpay API keys from the Razorpay dashboard (`Accounts & Settings → API Keys`) and paste them into the app authentication page.  
  


  3. **Configure Webhooks**  
In your Razorpay dashboard (`Accounts & Settings → Webhooks`), add the following Webhook URL:  
`https://backend.leadconnectorhq.com/razorpay/webhook`  
Be sure to enable **all payment-related events** for proper syncing.  
  


  4. **Register and Whitelist Your Domain**

     * In your GHL dashboard, go to `Settings → Business Profile → Branded Domain` and register the domain you're using. Make sure to verify and click on update information.  
  


     * Next, log in to your Razorpay dashboard and go to `Accounts & Settings → Business Website Details → Add Additional Website/App Details`.  
Add the same branded domain here. Razorpay will verify and enable it.

> **Note** : Razorpay only allows payment acceptance from domains that have been whitelisted on their dashboard.

Once the app is installed, the Authentication page would be displayed which would require you to plug in your API keys from the Razorpay dashboard. Navigate to **Accounts & Settings -> API keys **to get the API keys from your Razorpay dashboard.

For smooth functioning of the integration in fetching the transaction statuses from Razorpay, it is required that you also paste the given link in your razorpay dashboard under Webhooks (**Accounts & Settings -> Webhooks**). Make sure that you select the following webhooks events to not lose out on any feature

Also, add [](<//link.fastpaydirect.com>)any branded domain that you are using inside the Razorpay dashboard (**Accounts & Settings -> Business website details**)

  


  


The application would in no way differ from the existing payment integrations like Stripe/NMI/[Authorize.net](<http://authorize.net/>) and would have full capabilities for payments including post purchase automations like automated sales receipts, refunds, payment received and order submitted triggers or giving discounts via coupon codes

  


  


**FAQs**  
  
**Q - I have done the integration, but while accepting payment I am getting an email from Razorpay saying - payment attempted on your merchant ID - XXXX from web domain - link.fastpaydirect.com has failed as it is not registered. Please contact risk-notification@razorpay.com for more details.**

  


**A:** This error occurs because Razorpay restricts payment processing from unregistered or unverified domains. Each merchant ID on Razorpay must be mapped to a whitelisted domain as part of their [website compliance policy](<https://razorpay.com/docs/payments/dashboard/account-settings/business-website-details/>).

By default, GHL uses **link.fastpaydirect.com** as its branded domain, which is whitelisted only for GHL’s own merchant account. It will not work with your Razorpay keys.

To resolve this, you need to **register your own branded domain** in GHL (as in step 4). Once your domain is connected, Razorpay recognizes it as part of your whitelisted setup, and payments will process successfully.

  
**Q - Will this Razorpay Integration also work for SaaS mode and Wallet recharges?  
** A: Although we support SaaS mode and Wallet recharges with Custom Payment Provider (one type if Razorpay) with specific to Razorpay, it will not work. This is because Razorpay doesn't support off-session charging on saved cards via our Integration. Only fixed-duration Subscprtions are supported.
