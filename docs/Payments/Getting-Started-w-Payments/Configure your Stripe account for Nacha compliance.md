### **Overview**

Stripe is tightening requirements for ACH Direct Debit to align with Nacha operating rules. If you accept US bank account payments through HighLevel using Stripe, you may need to update your Stripe account details so customers can clearly identify your business on bank statements and have a way to contact you.

### **What you need to do in Stripe**

You must choose how Stripe should classify your bank payment transactions. Stripe provides three options:

  1. Automatically classify transactions  
Stripe determines whether each transaction represents a purchase of goods based on available signals such as merchant information and transaction details. This works for most businesses and requires no code changes.

  2. Classify all ACH transactions as goods  
Choose this if you exclusively sell physical or digital products. All ACH transactions are classified as purchases of goods.

  3. Do not classify any transactions as goods  
Choose this if you provide services, accept donations, or collect bill payments rather than selling goods.

**FAQ**

####   
**Does HighLevel make these updates for me**

No. These are settings on your Stripe account, so you must update them in Stripe Dashboard.

####   
**What should I use as my statement descriptor**

Use a name customers will recognize as your business, since that is what appears on bank statements for ACH Direct Debit. ([Stripe Docs](<https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit?utm_source=chatgpt.com> "ACH Direct Debit | Stripe Documentation"))
