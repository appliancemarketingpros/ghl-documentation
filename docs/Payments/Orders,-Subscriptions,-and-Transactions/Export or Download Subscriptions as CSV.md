## **Overview**

  
The **Subscriptions CSV Export** feature allows you to download subscription records from the **Payments → Subscriptions** dashboard.

  
You can export:  
  


  * Every subscription in the account, or

## **How to Export Subscriptions**  
  


  1. Go to **Payments → Subscriptions**  
  


  2. (Optional) Apply search or filters:  
  


     * Status (Active, Canceled, Past Due, etc.)  
  


     * Product type  
  


     * Customer details

## **Understanding the Data Format**

  
Subscriptions often include multiple:  
  


  * Products (line items)  
  


  * Taxes


  
Therefore, **one subscription may generate multiple rows** in the file —one row per **line item** and **tax** entry (if applicable).

This is required for accurate product-level and tax-level reporting.  
  


> **Tip: When summarizing totals in Sheets/Excel →  
>  Group values by Subscription ID to avoid double counting.**

## **Data Consistency Guarantees (Exports Upgrade)  
**  


Subscriptions exports are formatted for stable billing analytics and audit-ready reporting.

**0 vs blank values**  
  


  * **0** appears only when the field applies and the value is truly zero.  
  

  * **Blank** appears only when the field does not apply (for example, trial fields when no trial exists).


**Stable structure for reporting**  
  


  * Column ordering is consistent to support pivots, imports, and BI pipelines.  
  

  * Multi-row subscription output is intentional for product-level and tax-level accuracy; group by **Subscription id** to avoid double-counting.

## **Example of Multi-Row Subscription Data**

  


 _Example 1:_  
  
A single subscription with:  
  


  * 3 products  
  


  * 2 taxes - both exclusive


  
The CSV could generate a total of **6 rows** :  
  


  * **2 rows for each products**  
  


  * **6 rows for taxes, where tax amount against each tax name for each product is a new row**  
→ All **share the same Subscription id**


  


 _Example 2:_  
  
A single subscription with:  
  


  * 3 products

  * 2 taxes - both exclusive on product 1, both inclusive on product 2 and no tax on product 3.  
  


The CSV could generate a total of **5 rows** :  
  


  * **2 rows for 2 products and 1 row for the 3rd product**  
  


  * **4 rows for taxes i.e. first 2 taxes are in the format <Tax Name 1> and <Tax Name 2> and next 2 taxes are in the format <Tax Name 1 (Included in prices)> and <Tax Name 2 (Included in prices)>; 5th row doesn't have any values in the tax columns **→ All **share the same Subscription id**

## **FAQs**

### **1\. Why do I see multiple rows per subscription?**

Because each product and/or tax is broken out individually for accurate reporting.

###   


### **2\. Will canceled subscriptions be included in exports?**

Yes — unless you filter by Status before exporting.

###   


### **3\. Does my export show latest updated values and details based on a subscription update action?**

Yes, the export shows latest data on the subscription irrespective of the starting data of the subscription i.e. if product, quantities, etc. change, then the latest would reflect on the export.

###   


### **4\. Can I export subscription billing history?**

For complete billing history → use **Transactions Export**.

###   


### **5\. Who can download subscription exports?**

Only users with permission to:  
✔ View Subscriptions  
✔ Export Subscriptions

###   


### **6\. Is customer address included?**

Only if collected via checkout — otherwise columns remain blank.

###   


### **7\. Why is Subscription End blank?**

That means the subscription is still active, unpaid, trialing, scheduled, etc. i.e. subscription has not ended yet.
