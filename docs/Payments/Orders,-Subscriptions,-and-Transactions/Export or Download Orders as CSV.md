## **Understanding the CSV Format**

  
Orders may include multiple:  
  


  * Products  
  


  * Taxes


  
Therefore, **a single order can spread across multiple rows** in the file.  
  


This helps display product-level pricing and tax clarity needed for bookkeeping and analytics.

## **Data Consistency Guarantees (Exports Upgrade)  
**  


Orders exports are formatted for reliable reconciliation and reporting across product, tax, and payment fields.

**0 vs blank values**  


  * **0** appears only when the field applies and the value is truly zero.  
  

  * **Blank** appears only when the field does not apply (for example, a payment method on an unpaid order).


**Stable structure for reporting**  


  * Column ordering is consistent to support pivots, imports, and BI pipelines.  
  

  * Multi-row orders are expected when products and tax entries exist; use **Internal order id** when grouping totals.

## **How Multi-Row Orders Work (Important)**

  
_Example 1:_  
  
A single order with:  
  


  * 3 products  
  


  * 2 taxes - both exclusive


  
The CSV could generate a total of **6 rows** :  
  


  * **2 rows for each products**

  * **6 rows for taxes, where tax amount against each tax name for each product is a new row**  
→ All **share the same Order id**


  


 _Example 2:_  
  
A single order with:  
  


  * 3 products  
  


  * 2 taxes - both exclusive on product 1, both inclusive on product 2 and no tax on product 3.


  
The CSV could generate a total of **5 rows** :  
  


  * **2 rows for 2 products and 1 row for the 3rd product**

  * **4 rows for taxes i.e. first 2 taxes are in the format <Tax Name 1> and <Tax Name 2> and next 2 taxes are in the format <Tax Name 1 (Included in prices)> and <Tax Name 2 (Included in prices)>; 5th row doesn't have any values in the tax columns**  
→ All **share the same Order id**

## **FAQs**

###   
**1\. Why am I seeing multiple rows for the same order?**

Because each product and product tax requires a separate accounting line for accurate reporting.

###   


### **2\. Why is Payment Method empty on some orders?**

Orders only show a payment method if a transaction occurred.

###   


### **3\. Will unpaid or abandoned orders be included?**

Yes — unless filtered out.

###   


### **4\. Can I check subscription billing details from this export?**

This export shows **order-level** subscription presence (count), not subscription billing history.  
Use **Subscriptions CSV Export** for that.

###   


### **5.****Can I re-export past orders?**

Yes — exports are always generated fresh.

###   


### **6\. Who can download order exports?**

Users with permissions to:  
✔ View Orders  
✔ Export Orders
