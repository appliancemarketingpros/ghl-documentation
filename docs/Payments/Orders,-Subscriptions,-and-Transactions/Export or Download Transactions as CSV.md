## **How to Export Transactions**  


  1. Go to **Payments → Transactions**  


  2. Apply filters/search if needed  
 _(e.g., date range, payment status, source type)_  


  3. Click **Download** Icon  
  


  4. A secure download link will be emailed to the logged-in user  
  


> **Security Note:** The email link is valid for 7 days and is unique to the requesting user.

* * *

## **Email Delivery Behavior**  


  * Export link arrives within minutes  
  


  * File is downloaded **via the emailed link** , not directly in-app  
  


  * If the link expires → simply generate a new export


* * *

## **CSV Structure & Formatting Rules**

  
Each **row may not always equal one transaction**.

  
A single transaction can include multiple:  
  


  * Products → creates **multiple line rows**  


  * Taxes → creates **one row per unique tax name per product**  


  * Miscellaneous charges (processing charges, late fees, tips)


  
This ensures each financial component is separately identifiable. To ensure clarity, if the same transaction has multiple rows, not all columns are populated in each row, mostly unique product or tax related data is populated in each row and full data is available only on 1 row per transaction.

## **Data Consistency Guarantees (Exports Upgrade)**

These exports are designed for reconciliation, accounting, and BI workflows with stable formatting and predictable values.

**0 vs Blank Values**  
  


  * **0** appears only when the field applies and the value is truly zero.  
  

  * **Blank** appears only when the field does not apply to that row/record.


**Stable Structure For Reporting**  
  


  * Column ordering is consistent to support pivots, imports, and BI pipelines.  
  

  * Multi-row formatting is intentional for product-level and tax-level allocation (do not assume “one row = one transaction”).

## **Special Formatting Notes**

  * Multiple products → **creates multiple rows** under same Transaction ID

  * Multiple taxes → **each tax appears on a separate row and belongs to the product line items i.e. each tax will have a unique row against a product.**  
  
So if 2 products have the same tax rates (2), the total line items for the transaction would be 4 i.e. line item 1 with tax 1 and tax 2 would make 2 rows and then line item 2 with tax 1 and tax 2 would be 2 more rows.

  * Combined payments (e.g., Card + Gift Card) → shown distinctly in value columns  
If filtering by totals, always aggregate carefully in spreadsheets.

  * **Tax rate precision**  
Tax rate (percentage) values export with **4 decimal places** (for example, **7.1250%**) to support fractional tax rates and consistent reporting. Tax amount values remain **rounded to 2 decimals** based on currency standards.

## **FAQs**

###   
**1\. Why does a single transaction show multiple rows in the CSV?**

Because products are tracked per line item and tax details are tracked per unique tax name. This is standard for accounting-grade reporting.

###   


### **2\. Why does Total Amount Due differ from Total Amount Paid?**

  * Processing charges

  * Tips

  * Partial payments  
… impact the **final payment** , not the **original due amount**.


###   


### **3\. Why don't I see some transactions in My Export?**

Check that:

  * Filters are cleared

  * Correct date range is applied


###   


### **4\. Will exporting include failed transactions?**

Yes — unless you filter to include only Successful or Refunded.

###   


### **5\. Does the export include partial refunds?**

Yes — **Amount Refunded** reflects the full cumulative refunded amount.

###   


### **6\. Can I regenerate a previously exported file?**

Yes — the export can be repeated anytime.

###   


### **7\. Who can export transactions?**

Only users with permissions to **view transactions** and **export records**.
