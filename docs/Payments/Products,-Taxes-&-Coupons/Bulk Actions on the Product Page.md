## **Filtering Products for Bulk Actions**

  


Use the filtering panel to narrow down product selection before applying bulk actions. You can combine filters with Select All for more targeted bulk operations. Using filters to isolate a group before performing actions can reduce the risk of editing the wrong products.  
  


Available filters include:  
  


  * **Store Visibility:** Included / Hidden  
  


  * **Collections:** By name  
  


  * **Source:** All Products, Woocommerce


  


To apply a filter, click the **Filters** button in the upper right corner then choose your filters from the drop down.

## **Edge Cases & Important Notes**

  


### **Behavior & Limitations:**

  


  * **Negative Value Protection** : Price changes that would lead to a negative value will be skipped for those products. Others will still update.  
  


  * **One Action at a Time** : You must wait for the current bulk operation to complete before starting a new one.  
  


  * **Global Store Visibility** : Visibility changes apply across all connected stores. To exclude a specific store, use the **Sites** section instead _(Sites > Stores > Select a Store > Products)_.  
  


  * **Value Required for Price Updates** : ‘Increase’ or ‘Decrease’ actions require an existing value for Price or Compare-at Price. Products without a base value remain unaffected.  
  


  * **Deletion Confirmation for Large Sets** : Deleting more than 50 products requires typing **“Delete”** in the confirmation prompt. Deleted products cannot be recovered.  
  


  * **Bulk Delete and Restricted Products:** Bulk delete does not fail if restricted products are selected. HighLevel automatically skips restricted products, and only eligible products are deleted. Restricted products include:  
  


    * Calendar-created products  
  

    * Memberships/Communities-created products  
  

    * SaaS products with active or past_due subscriptions

  * **Bulk Performance Warning** : Changes on over 300 products may take a few moments to reflect.


  


### **Selection Behaviour:**

  


Action| What Happens  
---|---  
Click top checkbox| Selects all products on the current page.  
Navigate away and return| Selection is retained (for current page selection only).  
Use “Select All” for entire list| If you navigate away, the selection will **not** be retained.
